Originally, I had the program write the poem to the file after it wrote to the screen.  This required me to edit a list to look more like a poem, but it never worked well.  I could not remove the quotation marks around each line.  So I switched gears and had the program write to the file line by line as part of the for loop.  I had to figure out how to put newlines after each line, but that turned out to be relatively simple.  Itâ€™s not fancy, but it works.
