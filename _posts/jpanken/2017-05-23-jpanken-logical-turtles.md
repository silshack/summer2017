My program has a fair number of flaws that I was not able to solve.  For one, there is no fail-safe if the user inputs the wrong color for color_1 and color_2.  One way to solve that might have been to use a if, elif, else statement.  I also could have tried to make the try/except statement work for that issue, though I haven’t had very much success with that one. 

 Unfortunately, I have not been able to make the try/except statement at the end work.  I am not sure what the problem is (if I knew that, I would fix it).  I think part of the issue might be that it doesn’t recognize undefined input so it is not generating an error.  I don’t quite know how to generate an error in a turtle program without Trinket flagging the error and refusing to run.  Instead, I put in an if, elif, else, statement so that the program would still do as it was intended.  It works, but not the way that I would like it to.

I had a lot of difficulty with the try/except statement on the exercises so this might be part of that issue.  Though my impulse would be to avoid using the try/except statement, that won’t help me learn.  Instead, I will try to use it again and again.
