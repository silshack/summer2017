When I started this, I had almost no idea what I was doing.  So I looked at the raw output and figured out how the indenting worked and played around with indexes.  I tried to separate out the zipcode, but I couldn’t get rid of that last comma with strip or rstrip or remove.  I decided to structure my program so that the categories most likely to come up empty would be at the end.  This was so that the program didn’t stop while I was working on it, but I left it that way in the posted program.
