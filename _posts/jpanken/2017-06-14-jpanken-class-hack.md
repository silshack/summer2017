Even though I’m doing the data analysis, I thought that I would get my bearings by experimenting with Turtle.  I decided to do the Turtle Treasure Hunt, using a class object as a treasure instead of using a turtle.  That was pretty easy, so I tried to make multiple treasures.  I couldn’t get the logic right to get that to work, so I switched gears and made mines.  Since I was using identical classes, I combined them into a single class called “Buried.”  I specified one as “gold” and the others as “dynamite”, “quicksand”, and “mine.”  I played with the parameters a little until I felt like the mines were really a hazard.  


If I were to develop this further, I might make some kind of warning sign that you are close to a mine.  Perhaps the turtle’s outline could change colors or it could glow.  I would also try to make the multiple treasure thing work.  I think that now I have a better sense of class so, hopefully, it will be easier to apply class to the data analysis.  You gotta walk before you can run.
