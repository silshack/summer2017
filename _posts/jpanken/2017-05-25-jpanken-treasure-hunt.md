title: Jaffa's Sleepy Turtle Treasure Hunt
---

I haven’t solved many problems, but it’s 2:30 AM and I have work tomorrow.  Hint to novice programmers: try not to accidentally delete your work multiple times.  


My biggest problem was that I originally did a game where the turtle moves by clicking, but I couldn’t figure out how to prevent the program from jumping the gun on calculating the distance.  So I switched to an input program and changed the parameters of my screen so that the program wasn’t so annoying.  


In the end, I couldn’t figure out how to stop the program after someone wins.  Also, the celebration for winning is totally lame.  A project for another time...
