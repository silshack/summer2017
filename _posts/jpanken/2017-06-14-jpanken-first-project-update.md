Since my last post, I downloaded and cleaned different data for my final on Kickstarter.  Now, my data is divided into successful and failed projects.  When you change your data, you also change what you can do with your data.  As a result, I have been able to think of many potential directions to go in my project.  Right now, much of my program is commented out so that I can focus on making one piece work at a time.  I am in the middle of two major pieces: building a series of options menus as scaffolding for the program and creating a help dictionary.


The options menus are forcing me to make some tough choices about how much data to present and how to describe what I am offering.  To back those decisions, I decided to have an all-purpose help dictionary that will have entries with background on each dataset and types of data.  


### Milestones
- [x] Import clean data files into program
- [x] Compile each column in list for ease of use
- [ ] Options menus with 2-3 layers
- [ ] Offer a help dictionary in all of the options menus
- [ ] Provide additional information about datasets and types of data
- [ ] Divide data into logical subsets for the options menus
- [ ] Consider option to compare/contrast successful and failed projects
- [ ] Develop error management
- [ ] Settle on format for data visualization
