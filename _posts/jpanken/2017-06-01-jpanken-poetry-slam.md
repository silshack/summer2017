title: "Jaffa's Eclectic Poetry Slam"
---

For this exercise, it was important to me that the formatting reflect the improvisational, eclectic qualities of slam poetry.  To achieve this goal, I used random choice of font size and alignment.  I ran the program over and over to get the spacing between the lines right even for the largest font size.  I had wanted to change the spacing according to the font size, but it proved unreliable and I liked the uneven effect.  To have the 16pt font, I sacrificed space to input longer lines.  I figured that slam poetry often ignores grammar rules (especially re: run-on sentences) so it was unnecessary to have a single sentence on one line.
