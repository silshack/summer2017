Prior to reading the textbook
-Dictionaries are lists that can contain different types of data (it's like a list of lists)
-Dictionary have keys that must be unique (otherwise they will write over each other)
-keys can be any type of data
-python does some mathematical magic that moves the keys around in the dictionary and thus will print in a different order every time
-you can use loops to populate or add to a dictionary
-you can use a dictionary to store information that would be useful to return to a game player later
-you can index dictionaries like lists
-an empty dictionary is defined by {}

Additional things I learned while reading the textbook 
-keys map to values, they are called a key-value pair or an item
-you can use [] to call an item from the dictionary
-len(dictionary) will return number of key-value pairs
-looping through a dictionary makes counting easy
-you can use the translate function to remove punctionation when counting the number of words in text
