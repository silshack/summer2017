I already started on my final project over the weekend. This is intended to be like one of those extra games in super mario brothers where you have to guess the right order in three boxes to get an extra life. I'm glad I started this early because I kept not knowing how to solve problems and so I'd go do other things and think of a solution or be reminded of a turtle someone else in class had done that could be my solution.

The milestones I've completed so far are

-create the mario that moves right and left and jumps
-create the turtle boxes that mario will hit
-create gameboard
-randomly generate numbers to assign to the turtle boxes
-change the color of the turtle boxes
-create boundaries for mario to stay within

Milestones yet to complete
-change the color of the turtles appropriatly, red if guessed wrong, green if guessed right
-have some counter that goes up when mario guesses correctly
-maybe create some animation when you when the guessing game
-fix the gameboard to make it look nicer
-fix the instructions to only flash when the user needs them
