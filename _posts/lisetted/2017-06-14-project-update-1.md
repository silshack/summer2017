Reflection:

I think I'm generally headed in the same direction as I was prior to class, but my  group did provide me some suggestions to solve some of my issues and some other ideas of how to improve my project and fulfill all the requirements. I think my biggest roadblock right now is getting the colors to change immediately after the mario turtle jumps. Once I solve that, my biggest roadblock will be to create multi-levels in the game.
