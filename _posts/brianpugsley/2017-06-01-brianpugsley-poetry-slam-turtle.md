Here is my original poetry slam:

I started with that because I wanted to get the basics down and figured that, if I got the "easy" stuff done, the more difficult/advanced stuff would come a little easier. I was able to write the basic slam pretty easily. I decided to just use a while loop. It took a few iterations to make sure the turtle moved enough so the text wasn't overlapping but also wasn't too far away.

Here is my more "advanced" version:

Figuring out how to limit the length of lines was a lot more difficult. I was working on it but wasn't getting anywhere so, I got up and took a walk. While on my walk, I figured out what I could do. It isn't very clean and the formatting is a bit off when it prints but, I was able to make the text "wrap". I tried a few different things for limiting the number lines that could be input but the loops kept breaking/looping.
