In working through this game, I'm continuing to work through the bugs. I still need to create the logic for when the car hits the frog or the frog hits the car. I plan on building that into the create cars function and the movement of the frog. I'm also having issues with the level not disappearing when the new level is created. I have a few milestones I still need to reach but have made some good progress.

-[X]Program draws roads, equally spaced
-[X]Program initiates with frog at bottom, middle of screen
-[X]Frog is able to move, one section at a time, in any direction.
-[X]Program won't allow frog to leave the screen
-[X]Program generates "win" when frog reaches other side of roads
-[X]Program has car turtles that drive on road
-[ ]If frog/car intersect, "lose"
-[ ]Program has multiple levels of difficulty
-[ ]Difficulty based on speed/number of cars
-[X]Program prints level
-[ ]Program has "new game" button or ability to restart
