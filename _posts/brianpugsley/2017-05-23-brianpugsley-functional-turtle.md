Originally, I created this Trinket for the Custom Turtle exercise:

I thought it was pretty cool and it took a little time to get everything where I wanted/needed it. But, with this new assignment, after getting comfortable with loops and functions, I was able to make the program a lot better, in my opinion. I was able to customize the color of the flowers. I added some input functions that allow the user to determine whether it is day or night, what color the flowers are going to be and, if they do choose night, how many starts there will be. 

I had to experiment a bit with the sizes of the stars to make sure the ratio of the size of the starts to everything was relatively reasonable. Otherwise, the functions were pretty easy to implement. 

Here is the new and improved Trinket:
