Here is my logical post: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6a939de52f" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I am currently in the process of building a house and, recently, had to pick out/buy the flooring. I remembered thinking that it would be great if there was something I could just enter my measurements into to get a total of what I needed. This trinket also accounts for the error flooring installers like to build in (10%).

One thing I would do with this, if I had more time is print out a dilineated list of the room names along with their square footages/bundles needed in addition to the total.

The most challenging part I had was having the system hang up. I wasn't sure what was going on so I stepped away and, even then, couldn't figure it out. It only occurred when I chose to only enter the square footage for one room. After I entered all of the information, it would just hang. I assume it has something to do with my while statement.
