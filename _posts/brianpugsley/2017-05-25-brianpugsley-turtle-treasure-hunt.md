Here is my turtle treasure hunt:

This was a bit challenging at first. I decided to just try the click method because the input method seemed cumbersome for the user. However, it took me a while and quite a few iterations (and commenting out code) to determine that the while loop was causing the trouble. After I got rid of that, it started to work. Of course, it was 1:30AM so, I decided to stop there. 

I decided to just change the color of the turtle to signify how close you were to finding the treasure using the if/elif statements. To do the search and check whether or not it was close to the treasure, I stumbled upon the distance function. It saved me a lot of math.

I decided to make the celebration a bit more fun too.
