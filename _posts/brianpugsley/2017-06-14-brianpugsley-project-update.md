Here is my code, so far for my hangman game:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/0cf313e5e6" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- [ ] Allow user to enter letter using mouse
- [X] Allow user to enter letter using keyboard
- [X] Program receives letter input from user and determines if it is in the word.
- [X] Program pulls in a word from the list of words (another data file)
- [X] Program displays the word that it chose from the list.
- [ ] Program changes the color/bolds the letter if it was typed or clicked.
- [X] Program keeps track of how many times the player has entered an incorrect letter
- [ ] Once player reaches certain number of incorrects, lose happens.
- [ ] If player finds all of the letters without going over the limit of incorrect, win happens
- [ ] Program has three difficulty settings.
- [ ] Difficulty settings either determine length of the word or number of pieces already drawn on hangman.
 
 More advanced milestones:
- [ ] Background changes depending on difficulty level
- [ ] Program displays number of tries left on the screen.
- [X] Program draws a piece of a hangman each time an incorrect entry is made.
- [ ] Program displays letters already guessed
- [X] If a letter has already been guessed, program displays an error stating such.
- [ ] Program changes background/text color of on-screen keyboard if a letter has been selected.
- [ ] Program has a help button that displays instructions when clicked.
- [ ] Program gives player the option to enter their own list of words.

I still have a few bugs in the program and haven't finished some of the easier milestones but I think I'm well on my way.
