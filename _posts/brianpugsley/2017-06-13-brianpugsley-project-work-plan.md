In all honesty, I haven't had a lot of time to work on this. In brainstorming, I currently have two different ideas. One of my ideas is to make a hangman game. Here are some milestones I'd like to complete if I go in that direction
  - [ ] Allow the user to create their own word list.
  - [ ] Offer easy, medium, and hard
  - [ ] Allow the player to restart
  - [ ] Show a visual keyboard on the screen to show the letters that have been played.
  - [ ] Allow user to click OR type the letter.

My other idea is a data analysis for interlibrary loan. I'd like to able to visualize some data that shows where a book has been borrowed from. Here are a few milestones:
  - [ ] Allow the user to select two sets of data, US or international.
  - [ ] Allow the user to see the university that borrows the most.
  - [ ] Allow the user to parse sity and state
  - [ ] Include a map
