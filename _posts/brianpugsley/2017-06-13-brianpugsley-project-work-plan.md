In all honesty, I haven't had a lot of time to work on this. I decided on a hangman game though. Here are some milestones I'd like to complete:
  - [ ] Allow the user to create their own word list.
  - [ ] Offer easy, medium, and hard
  - [ ] Allow the player to restart
  - [ ] Show a visual keyboard on the screen to show the letters that have been played.
  - [ ] Allow user to click OR type the letter.
