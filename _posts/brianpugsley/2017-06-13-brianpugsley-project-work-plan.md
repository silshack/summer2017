In all honesty, I haven't had a lot of time to work on this. I decided on a hangman game though. Here are some milestones I'd like to complete:
  - [ ] Allow the user to create their own word list.
  - [ ] Offer easy, medium, and hard
  - [ ] Allow the player to restart
  - [ ] Show a visual keyboard on the screen to show the letters that have been played.
  - [ ] Allow user to click OR type the letter.
  

Updated plan:
After our discussions, I found out that some of my milestone were a little too "big" so, here are my updated milestones:
 - [ ] Allow user to enter letter using mouse or keyboard
 - [ ] Program receives letter input from user and determines if it is in the word.
 - [ ] Program pulls in a word from the list of words (another data file)
 - [ ] Program displays the word that it chose from the list.
 - [ ] Program changes the color/bolds the letter if it was typed or clicked.
 - [ ] Program keeps track of how many times the player has entered an incorrect letter
 - [ ] Once player reaches certain number of incorrects, lose happens.
 - [ ] If player finds all of the letters without going over the limit of incorrect, win happens
 - [ ] Program has three difficulty settings.
 - [ ] Difficulty settings either determine length of the word or number of pieces already drawn on hangman.
 
 More advanced milestones:
 - [ ] Background changes depending on difficulty level
 - [ ] Program displays number of tries left on the screen.
 - [ ] Program draws a piece of a hangman each time an incorrect entry is made.
 - [ ] Program displays letters already guessed
 - [ ] If a letter has already been guessed, program displays an error stating such.
 - [ ] Program changes background/text color of on-screen keyboard if a letter has been selected.
 - [ ] Program has a help button that displays instructions when clicked.
 - [ ] Program gives player the option to enter their own list of words.
