I am not going to be in class Thursday so I'm posting my response/solutions to the dictionary exercises:

I found these excercises extremely challenging but I knew that was going to be the case when I begin because we haven't actually covered them yet. But, I went to the textbook and took some time really studying the chapter. After working on the chapter and examining the questions a bit more, I was able to work through each part of the program, though it took quite a few iterations to get each to work properly.
