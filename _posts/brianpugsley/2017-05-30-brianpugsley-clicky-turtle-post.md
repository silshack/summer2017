title: "Brian's Clicky Turtle"
---

I decided to do a bit of experimenting with the clicking and key functions so, in this clickly turtle, there are two turtles: one is controlled by clicking and another is controlled using the arrow keys. You can also change the background color and clear the clouds that are drawn. I included instructions at the beginning and, in the future, could probably do a better job of conveying them. I didn't have any big light bulb moments during this project but I really did like being able to assign functions to particular keys and it was a lot of fun building this turtle.
