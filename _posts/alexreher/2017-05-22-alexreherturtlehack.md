Sudden python?

I spent way too long using Python3 instead of Python and it was giving me errors. I tried commenting out gradually but eventually just started a new file in Python. I had the raw_input issue and some other trouble related to a background that I didn't end up liking.

I'd used the random tool for a previous exercise. This time I was originally going to have the python come from off-screen at a random location. I would have had an easier time if I'd edited the image into a square for easier math. I quickly realized that a flipped version of the image was needed so that if the python comes from the right it wouldn't be upside down.

In the future maybe I'll combine a second off-screen python with an if statement to have the right one show up and not look terrible. The only other part I wanted to improve immediately was the turtle getting eaten. A fade would have looked good but google didn't show me any opacity function.
