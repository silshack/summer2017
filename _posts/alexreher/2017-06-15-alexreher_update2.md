###Old Milestones
 - [x] Get data sample for textbooks
 - [x] File ingest
 - [x] Parse Call number ranges
 - [x] Make callnum dictionary
 - [ ] Instantiate classes for shelves
 - [ ] Add counts
 - [ ] Ask user what they want 
 - [ ] Percents from each spot in table
 - [ ] branch selection
 - [ ] Max from regions
 - [ ] Avg/Min from regions
 - [ ] Ask user min/max/avg
 
 I started on my menu and a shelf range reader last night, but I haven't implemented any more of the back-end function since yesterday. Friday and Saturday have lots of time set aside for coding. That's always been part of the plan, so my limited code progress hasn't been too worrying.
My plan has definitely changed from early on. I didn't get the data I wanted quick enough, and it has dramatically cut down on my initial stretch goals. I could have pushed harder for the data I wanted initially, but I was reluctant to press my boss for it. After switching data sets I didn't have a clear vision for my project. Sitting with it for a couple days though, I see what can be done and have thought of the logic of implementation. Coding will take time, and some problems will arise, but with the time I've had to thing about it I think I'll be in good shape for Monday.

By Monday I want the range selection stats and a basic shelf viz working. Help and variable settings on the stats/shelves can wait until the core of the program works.
