The way classes work made sense logically, but watching the video and doing the reading I still didn't feel very assured with the implementation. I tried making a new class altogether at first, but was running into trouble so I went with a turtle extension. It ended up working but I had to go back and forth between my code and resources to get the init to work correctly. I don't feel like I have any time to step away from issues when I get stuck so I just had to grind out progress. I need to reapproach this topic at another time because I don't feel confident in my ability to implement classes in a useful way.
