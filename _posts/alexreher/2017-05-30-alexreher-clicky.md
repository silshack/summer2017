I call it TurplePircleCurtle:

First I added the option to move with keys and create a turtle at the point where you clicked. From there I initially tried to add boundary detection and have the click send a turtle in the direction of the click from the tina point. It didn't work so I just sent it a distance of 100. Finally I added some graphical variation based on quadrant to make it look a little cooler.
