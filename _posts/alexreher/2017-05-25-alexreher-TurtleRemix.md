I managed to get clicking to work. I was playing around with the math to see if I could make it a little more challenging by making the turtle go close to, but not exactly to the point you click. That way, if I expanded it, I could add some fail conditions like mines or going out of bounds.

Figuring out the best way to do the distance calculation without doing a simple goto was tricky. I also initially tried to make the click event return values, but that didn't work. I think if I go back to it another day there's probably a solution.
