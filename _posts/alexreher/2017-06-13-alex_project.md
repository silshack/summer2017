This summer my boss at work, who loves ILL service, wanted to visualize the service, and I think this is the perfect opportunity. I'd like to try to import the data for different time periods and  express the counts based on city/schools/regions/networks. The networks are a chance to incorporate a dictionary. I'm not sure how to implement the class yet. Making the visualization an animation or on a map would be ideal. I don't know about the end stages of the project because its all uncharted territory.
