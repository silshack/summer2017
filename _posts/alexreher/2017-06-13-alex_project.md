This summer my boss at work, who loves ILL service, wanted to visualize the service, and I think this is the perfect opportunity. I'd like to try to import the data for different time periods and  express the counts based on city/schools/regions/networks. The networks are a chance to incorporate a dictionary. I'm not sure how to implement the class yet. Making the visualization an animation or on a map would be ideal. I don't know about the end stages of the project because its all uncharted territory.

###Inter-library loan visualization

- [ ] Get data sample for lending
- [ ] File ingest
- [ ] Parse city/state
- [ ] COunts
- [ ] Regions/countries
- [ ] Map
- [ ] Borrowing 

Updated Plan:

For Wednesday, I'd just like to get the data in and read the pieces that are relevant to my data viz. Next I'd like to create a dictionary of the locations.

For Thursday, I want classes set up for regions and counts for locations and regions.

For Friday, I want functions for min/max/avg and the option to select desired outputs.

For Monday, I want the visualization of the data to look interesting

For Thursday, make it look good. Look at maps.
