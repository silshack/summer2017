I want to create a text based game that acts similar to an interactive, choose your own adventure, story game. This game will be based on the world of Ghost Recon Wildlands. Within the game I will have a full backstory to the game, characters, character stats, a map with many missions, bosses, etc. Like a choose an adventure game, at different turns in the game the player will have a couple of options to pick from, each of these options will result in different outcomes.


I am passionate about this project because I wanted to do this before I even got involved with this class. In fact, I was considering writing this as a physical book, but instead, I now plan on taking this on for my final. The program will include an excel data file that contains all of the information about the games map, and a dictionary of dictionaries will be created from it that will be used to run the game. There will also be historgram data of the players stats available to print to the console. Custom functions, custom modules, and custom variables have already been integrated. While I will eventually finish this project, for the final I will only create a demo. The reason for this is because doing a full 21 missions, for 4 characters, with multiple outcomes could result in 320 separate narratives being written. Instead, I will program 2 full missions for 4 different characters, and release the program as a demo of the full game that will still be fully functional through those 2 missions.


Things I want in my game (Milestones)
<ul> 4 different characters to choose from </ul>
<ul> 21 different regions/missions/bosses to play (2 in demo) </ul>
<ul> different outcomes depending on decisions the play makes throughout the game </ul>
<ul> player stats that are kept throughout playing the game that can be printed on command (displayed as visual data (histogram)) </ul>
<ul> ability for player to print out the available regions/missions to play, and have already played ones not show up as an option </ul>
<ul> once a certain number of missions are complete the final mission becomes available </ul>
<ul> once the final mission is completed a game over narrative comes up and the program ends </ul>
