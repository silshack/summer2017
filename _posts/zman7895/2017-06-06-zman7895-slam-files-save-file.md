I smashed working on this after finishing the files exercises and working on my blackjack app. Therefore, by the time I put eyes on this I was dead and gone. Never a good idea. I stared at the screen without really doing anything or taking anything in. I decided to just go to bed and wake up and re-read the chapter. Once I got to the section in the chapted identifying how to do this it was relatively simple. Sometimes I think my biggest problem is just picking and choosing when to work on stuff. A lot of the time I am not actually struggling with the concepts of programming but more struggling with life choices haha! Just kidding, but not really.
