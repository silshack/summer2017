The first decision was that of deciding between option 1 and option 2. My first gut instinct was try option 2 simply because we had seen some code for mouse clicks in class and I wanted to do something I hadn't seen. But then, for the first time in this class I thought more in terms of usability than I did about just trying something new. I thought to myself how infrequently I use the keyboard to control a cursor on the screen versus using a mouse. I only use the keyboard to type, but never for arrow control. Therefore I decided to use option 1.


After choosing option 1, I decided to just work around understanding the basics as I have with past exercises and understand how the clicky function would operate and whatnot before I started figuring out what I wanted to do. Once I wrapped my head around that I began the creative process. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it. I knew I didn't want to just send a turtle somewhere with a click. Therefore, I decided to make it just do a little something more. In the end, I kind of settled for it going to a location and then didn't do much more than that besides drawing a few things on the screen where the user clicked. This was more for time constraints and I actually plan on going back and having more happen when an input click happens.


For the first time, the issues I ran into with this exercise were more about my design and creativity choices and flaws rather than not being able to take the creativity ideas I had and implement them because I was short on python knowledge. That is a good sign for how things are coming along with the class, but bad sign for my head!!
