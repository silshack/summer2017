I love Amanda’s game. From the code to the game itself, it is made for the user. First, I will speak on the game side. From the get go, the instructions are so elaborate, yet so concise at the same time. Like I said in class, people who didn’t know how the basics of this game work, can immediately understand what is going to happen once they start playing. These instructions are brilliant, and have even inspired me to want to add some further instruction into my game. In addition, the game is personalized with the addition of having the player add their name into the game. I didn’t see that in any other game including my own. Very unique, very smart, very cool. Also, the game itself is straightforward, which is a good thing when playing a game. I never liked monopoly because there were too many moving pieces and too hard to comprehend. This game anybody can sit down and play away with no confusion or no need to give a lot of time to it. It is great! I feel like I catered my app to the more professional style blackjack players, but would turn away or discourage the typical person from playing. This game does the opposite and attracts any and all audiences. If I learned anything from the show Shark Tank, if you limit your potential audience, you are losing out on potential profit! 


As for the code, it matches the game. The code is very readable. I can follow it line by line, understand what each section is, what is happening, and how it effects the game. More than any other aspect of Amanda’s app, this is what I am most jealous of. I could learn a thing or two about everything from commenting, to spacing, to just logical flow and order. It is easy to look at, and pretty to look at. You can tell she took a ton of time to make it this way, and then after reading her reflection it is confirmed that this is the case. I give major props for this aspect. 


As for what the project asked for, I see almost all of it in her app. There are custom functions on lines 8, 16, 20, and 41. There is a definite loop on line 62. I already mentioned the comments and the clearness to the program. The program runs without errors. All the basics of the game were hit. And lastly, she imported the random module to her main.py. Overall, it looks like all the criteria was hit. 


I have hit on several differences between my program and Amanda’s, but there were several similarities as well. The passion and excitement we were overcome with when found out about the assignment sound very similar. We both brainstormed excessively before we started working. We both had a detailed milestone list with a ton of unique ideas. Reading about Amanda’s idea for other AI players that would sit beside the player was fascinating. I was excited reading her reflection because I could see many of the things I went through being shared as well as feel many of the similar emotions. Overall, I love her game, I love her extremely clear code, and I feel very close to her when I read her reflection!
