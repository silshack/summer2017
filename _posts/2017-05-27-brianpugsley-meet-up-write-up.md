I attended the TriPython, May 2017 meeting 05-25-2017 at the WebAssign building on NCSU's Centennial Campus. It was a very interesting event. Stacy Morse discussed micro-services, a different way to build programs/apps. It uses small, compartmentalized programs that do not have many ties between each other. Instead, the services send "messages" to a particular service that then has "workers" that take them to the right location to be processed. From what I understood from the discussion, it is a process that has high costs upfront but, once deployed, the upkeep of the app/build is a bit easier. Because you don't have a lot of interconnected pieces of the program/build/app, you are able to modify certain parts without having to modify your entire code. 

I was a little nervous heading in because I am so new to Python but it was a great experience. It was really interesting to hear, at the beginning of the meeting, all of the different skill levels of the people that were there. I expected the attendes to all be very experienced coders who worked with python professionally but, there were quite a few that talked about their recreational use of Python. It was also really interesting to hear about all of the different companies that the attendees worked for and how they used Python. Before this course, I didn't really hadn't hear about Python.

I think there is definitely value in this type of event, after class. I hope to continue coding after this course is over and, it was really cool to see the level of support everyone was willing to give and the general comradery between everyone. I had a lot of fun and believe I will find value in this type of meeting/group in the future.
