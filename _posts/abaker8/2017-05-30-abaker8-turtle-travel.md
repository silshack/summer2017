For this assignment, I really liked the whole concept. I had originally wanted to do something different, but then my fantasy side showed through. The objective of the game is to not get captured by the demon turtles which are hidden. There are two platforms: mountain and ocean.
The biggest struggle I had was in testing the code. Since it requires the user to click into the turtle-field, I was unable to test the code. I have it all written out how I think it should run, but I do not know if it will work. I also really enjoyed coming up with the jumping pattern for the turtle. I think some of my code could be condensed, but writing it out this way really helps me to ensure that I follow each step and donâ€™t miss anything.
