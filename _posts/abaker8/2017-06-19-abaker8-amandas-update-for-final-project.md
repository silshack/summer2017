This weekend was a code-filled weekend. I did some changes on my while loop since I was not happy with the way it was running and since it was not breaking. I then added option 2 setting and I cannot wait to just print the status/follow-up options. After I spoke with Elliott on Thursday, I was intent on figuring out dictionaries. I reread the chapter, looked up some online resources, tried to go over some people code on the page to see if I could understand what they wrote in our code summaries. I just was not getting there. After that, I went to the code meet-up, I tried to ask for some assistance regarding how to create the dictionary based on my data. Some people suggested I do the csv library import. I did some reading into it but not so much. While I thought this could be a great option, I was afraid of the errors and other issues I could run into. I do not think I am confident enough to import that library yet.  Then, I asked Zach if he could be of some assistance since he send our group an email on Thursday. It took him awhile, but he was finally able to get some progress. He told me it would be kind of hard to accomplish what I wanted to but I am intent on getting somewhere with it. I really think I am going to be able to maybe not accomplish all I wanted to but have a good program that will help people. Finally, Zach mentioned he was having issues converting the dictionary of abbreviations I made to pair with the dictionary. What I think I am going to do is have it as a help menu where the user can type in the abbreviation, player and a help-list-for-abbreviations. If the user selects the later, they will look at the list and then it will loop back to the input field so they can enter the chosen abbreviation.
