So for this code, I struggled in two ways. 1. After going back to my code later in the day, it made me enter the word three times before giving a response. I wish I had more time to step away to look it over. Secondly I was wondering how this could work with a word such as running? The infinitive of the word would be run not runn, but that would be removing the ING. What can one do to ensure you can get the correct root workd reardless of the stem.
