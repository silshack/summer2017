Here is my attempt at this treasure hunt. Since I am pretty new to turtle, i could not get it to work finally. I was having issues with my external code?

For this assignment, I really struggled a lot. Being that I have just started using turtle, I am not so good with figuring out the vast amount of commands available. Moreover, completeing this with the  anaimation was difficult since I think that is where a lot of the errors were. I struggled in thinking how to start, and how to represent these different things such as a hidden treasure, how to code for that etc. 


Any advice would be awesome
