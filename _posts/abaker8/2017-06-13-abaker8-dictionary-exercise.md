     I struggled a lot with this exercise figuring out how to get the best output. I knew right away to comment out the longitude and latitude because most people would not want that info. I knew searching by city, state and zipcode would yield the most relevant information so I began coding for that. I triedsetting variable name for city, state, county and zip, putting in the info the code provided. However, that did not end up working. I kept trying a few alternatives until I got this.
