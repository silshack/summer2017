title: 'Amandas meet-up reflection'

I went to a meet up Called Girl Developers this past weekend. I thought it was going to be more code talks, showing off projects a bit and talking about life experiences. However, this was a pretty disconnect group I feel. There were a few people that broke away and talked alone and then others who did not talk to anyone at all. However, the leaders of the group were great. No one at this code talk was too proficient in Python surprisingly. I went there hoping to learn more about the coding community, how to improve my skills and how to generally become a more confident coder. I got a lot of information from one person, Bridget, and lots of advice from another person, Mike. I learned I should keep trying, see if I could take an independent study or take more classes to really understand the basics of coding. Rather than work on the syntax, (although it is important) learn about how to develop the program step by step and then refer to a resource if the syntax is tripping you up. I think I would enjoy joining this type of professional community since I think they have a lot of great advice. I think this would be great after classes end since it would keep me on my programming game.
