title: "Amandas Final Project and Milestones"

For my final project, I thought it would be a great idea to do it on sports stats. I choose pitching statistics. When I started looking at what I could analyze, the biggest problem I found is that none of these files are transferable to a readable for in an excel file. Due to this, I am still deciding which files to retranslate over. My two current ideas are to either do leading pitchers in strike-outs for left and right-handed pitchers, or one file with leading strike-out pitchers and one file of current top pitchers. If I choose to do the former, I will have the top 100 left and right-handed pitchers each in a separate file. IF I choose the latter, which is more likely, I will have the top 100 strike-out pitchers and the league’s top 50-100 pitching stats.
My mile stone for this project are to:
•	Create the files
•	Input them in a tab in a trinket
•	Use a dictionary (data for dictionary not decided yet)
•	Customer modules 
•	Create function to find pitcher name, strikeouts, help function, more pitching data.
•	Use for loops
•	Classes
•	The idea is that the user can type in a pitcher’s name, it would need to be exact because finding all the potential ways to input their name would be too difficult and many pitchers have either the same first name or last name.  At that point, if they are a current pitcher all stats would be printed. If they are not, their strike out count, years active, left or right handed and other related things would be printed. I am thinking of doing something like a top ten lists as well.
•	Allow user to print max and min for certain stats
•	Allow user to specify a filename or not if they choose not to




Updated Milestones
•	Today I realized I was not able to do the original files I had chosen. So first I need to find the data files I will be analyzing
•	Create the files
•	Parce through the data 
•	Input them in a tab in a trinket
See if the files can be read by doing some basic coding
Once I can do this, try creating a basic function that can pull min or max or average from the file
•	Use a dictionary (data for dictionary not decided yet) In this dictionary have it retrieval by team name or something similar to that.
•	Custome modules: Have a function tab, main tab, each file tab, and maybe a dictionaries tab.
Create functions to retrieve different player data tbd once files are chosen but this would be like RBI, batting average, team, win loses maybe etc
•	Use for loops
•	Classes
•	make some stats retrieval by RBI, rbi, and search by name be exact since there are so many ways to input a name wrong.
•	Create try and except block if I can to work this out


Code will be posted soon, hopefully before class but still working on imputing the datafiles
