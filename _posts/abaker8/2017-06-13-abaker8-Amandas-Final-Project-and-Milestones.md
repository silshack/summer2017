For my final project, I thought it would be a great idea to do it on sports stats. I choose pitching statistics. When I started looking at what I could analyze, the biggest problem I found is that none of these files are transferable to a readable for in an excel file. Due to this, I am still deciding which files to retranslate over. My two current ideas are to either do leading pitchers in strike-outs for left and right-handed pitchers, or one file with leading strike-out pitchers and one file of current top pitchers. If I choose to do the former, I will have the top 100 left and right-handed pitchers each in a separate file. IF I choose the latter, which is more likely, I will have the top 100 strike-out pitchers and the league’s top 50-100 pitching stats.
My mile stone for this project are to:
•	Create the files
•	Input them in a tab in a trinket
•	Use a dictionary (data for dictionary not decided yet)
•	Customer modules 
•	Create function to find pitcher name, strikeouts, help function, more pitching data.
•	Use for loops
•	Classes
•	The idea is that the user can type in a pitcher’s name, it would need to be exact because finding all the potential ways to input their name would be too difficult and many pitchers have either the same first name or last name.  At that point, if they are a current pitcher all stats would be printed. If they are not, their strike out count, years active, left or right handed and other related things would be printed. I am thinking of doing something like a top ten lists as well.
•	Allow user to print max and min for certain stats
•	Allow user to specify a filename or not if they choose not to
