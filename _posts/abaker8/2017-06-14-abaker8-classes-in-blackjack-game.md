This class exercise made some sense. I read the suggested readings, tried some of the coding and then watched a few other videos to see if it made sense. Then I got to coding. I thought it would be a good idea to start simple and add a class to call for the user name. I couldnt get it to call. I started with the basic class code and then asked for the user to return their name. When that did not work, I tried coding some input and print statements but now it is giving me the error message that self isnt defined. What do I do?
