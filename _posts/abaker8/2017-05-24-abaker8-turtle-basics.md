For this, I am really happy with how it came out. My main goal was to have a house, with a window and I added a door and door knob. I really thought it would be cool to have turtle stepping stones leading to the house.
Surprisingly, the hardest part was the sky. For some reason, at first, my code wasnt filling the entire screen using forward and right directions so I just used goto instead.
