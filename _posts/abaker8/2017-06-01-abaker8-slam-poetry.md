Here is my slam poetry!

For this program, I had originally wanted to make it a callable function so create the list within the function, call the function and then have it print. When that did not work after some trial and error, I came up with this, much simpler code. While testing, something I noticed was that with turtle talk, it will say it is writing something to screen but it does not do it. I love the new feature that it says what it would be writing too screen though. So, in the end, since I knew that the program was running, I just put it in the regular turtle module. Some things I noticed while writing this was that there are a few diverse ways that one cold g about it. I struggled mostly at the end getting it to print to each separate line. I wanted to have it to be tina.write(spam, + “/n”) when I did this, and a few variations (adding parenthesis inside the brackets for the list etc.) I finally just looked up an alternative way and did the join function which was successful. For the future, a few things I want to do would be to add the length in so that it can alter the user if it is too long, After the person clicks done, have it stay on the screen for x number of seconds before prompting the user if they want to write another at which point I would clear it and create a new one amongst a few other ideas. These would-be styles so writing in old English would change the font, free verse would have a different background etc.
