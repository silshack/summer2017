Here's the program I'm embedding:

Reflection:

My idea for making a flower began on the first day of class when we learned to make circles. I first changed the background 
color to light blue and created a rectangle along the base of the screen filled green to make grass. To begin the flower, I clumped two 
circles together for each petal (it took me a while to get the size of the circle and their distances to work so that it didn't look 
like a mass of yellow). Then I had to find the center of the flower to make the pollen cluster. Afterwords, I calculated the distance
between the grass and the base of the flower to create the stem. It would have been smarter to create the stem first and draw the flower 
over it, but I didn't think of that at first. Inserting the stem into the beginning of the code messed up the petal position, so 
calculating its placement seemed like the easier alternative. Afterwords, I wanted to play with text some, so I added a few phrases 
scattered around the flower in different colors.


While this flower looks extremely simple, it actually took me over 2.5 hours to code. I had a really hard time with the petal placement, 
and initially, I was going to have triangles attached at the base of two circles (similar to a heart) to make up each of the individual 
petals. This turned out to be what took me a majority of an hour and I couldn't figure this out - could this be something we go over 
in class? I get lost with whether to use right or left and which way the angle turns from where the turtle is.
