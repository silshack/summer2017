I'm hoping that I completed this assignment correctly - in that the code produces 4 or so items of information for different areas that are entered. However, to do this, I simply commented out code and did not need to write any more code. Because of the simplicity of this task, I'm thinking that I may have misinterpreted the instructions. Additionally, I had a hard time creating scenarios where no location could be found. For the Atlantic Ocean, someone in Google Maps has chosen a token point to represent this feature. Even entering ridiculous potential zip codes still produced results in foreign countries.
