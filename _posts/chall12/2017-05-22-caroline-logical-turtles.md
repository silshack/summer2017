Reflection:


Looking at the list of topics to cover within this excercise seemed daunting at first, but made sense once I started to work on the problem and began to notice all of the relationships between the different coding components. Using all of the assignment's criteria was actually necessary, making the hardest part of the excercise the determination of the code's theme. As a student, grades and credits are oftentimes at the forefront of my mind, especially as it relates to ensuring all credit requirements are completed. Therefore, I thought it would be fun to create a code that would determine your academic standing and tell you how many more credits you need before you're eligible for graduation from undergrad.


To do this, the code prompts the user for the amount of credits that they have taken. Then, assuming that the average student takes 15 credit hours a semester (and therefore 30 per academic year), it creates ranges based on intervals of 30 to categorize students as a first year, sophomore, junior, or senior. Afer going through this set of if-then statements, if the value is less than the mandatory 120 for graduation, the code finds the difference between 120 and the entered number and tells the student how many more credits they need. When I first made the code, I had not yet completed the next few excercises for the chapter. However, after completing these assignments, I realized that it would be smart to make sure that an error popped up if the student entered an invalid value - so I included the try-except statements as well.
