Reflection:


I had some trouble getting trinket to work for me this weekend, so as a result I ran into some delays in my progress. Right now, my biggest struggle is getting the fish and coins/sharks to recognize that they have touched one another. After this, the point system shouldn't be too hard to implement. I think I'm going to make it so that the levels are based upon the number of sharks and coins that the user must make it through to survive. I'm feeling really anxious about finishing the project in time as my progress on this project has been coming along slowly. I have all of the hardest portions of the project remaining, but need to make it through this issue before I can even begin to solve them. I would like to talk through this with someone who is familiar with the concept (Thank you for your help in office hours!). I hope that I am able to keep to my plan; I've been working hard on this project all week, but it just takes me a long time to figure out problems like this one. It'll be nice to see the finished project!
