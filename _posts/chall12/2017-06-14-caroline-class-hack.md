This exercise was confusing until watching the videos that you've posted online. Seeing the code in action in a way that's more relevant to turtle drawings than databases in particular helped to make the concept click more. I did have a hard time figuring out where that black arrow turtle is coming from - I've hidden all of my turtles and none of them are colored black. I made the class work though and am happy about that!
