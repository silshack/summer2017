Trying this again because my last post got forked in a strange way.

Here is a link with the embedded code for my exercise:

Reflection: The right side shows my initial idea, just with fun patterns, whose color depends only on location and is consistent between every circle. The left side of the screen implements for loops and lists - making the computer pick a random color from a set list to fill in the circles. I personally like the way the right hand side looks more, which is why I'm leaving it to show my initial intent, but am also including the left hand side to show my ability to draw using loops, lists, and random. I struggled with figuring out a way to incorporate strings within this exercise, and recognize that having the user input their name as the beginning prompt is a little strange - but didn't know of another way to bring it into the code with what my clicking design is.
