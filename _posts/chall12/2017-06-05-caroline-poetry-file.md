Overall, this exercise was relatively straightforward. I'm hoping I included the writing program correctly because when I print my file like the example in the chapter 7 notes (where this is returned: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='output.txt' mode='w' encoding='cp1252'>), I get a result like this: <closedfile 'caroline', mode '[object Object]'>. However, the poem saves to a neat, uniquely named text file that appears next to my main.py. So the program works and creates the desired result, but the print statement returns something different.
