Reflection:


This assignment gave me a lot of trouble actually. I spent the majority of my time trying to figure out a way to get the turtle to move down with each additional line. At first I tried to make a y-value variable that was subtracted in value with each repetition of a loop; however, after struggling with this and messing with my turtle a few times, I thought back to how we usually draw shapes and moved towards a "tina.forward(20)" instead after rotating the turtle. This reduced the amount of variables that I was using and made the program actually run a lot smoother. I used a lot of my code from past assignments as a base code for entering the lines of poetry, so this portion of the assignment was not that difficult. In one of my past assignments as well, I made it so that the user could change the text that was within one of my drawings, so I referenced what I did there within this assignment as well. I thought it was kind of fun to have the text pop in random colors in typewriter font as well - this way the user's ideas are happy and show up more than the background or original prompts. This assignment was kind of fun! 


Additionally, I messed with trying to get the text to wrap, but couldn't figure out a way to do this. The way that I tried to think through the problem was to look at the length of a text entry and compare it to the pixel width of the screen, but couldn't figure out a way to accurately calculate the pixels of the characters. I may have been overthinking this portion of it.
