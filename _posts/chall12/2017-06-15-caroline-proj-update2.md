Here is what I have so far:

For Thursday: 
- [x] Complete drawing background
- [x] Make turtles for user, sharks (bad fish), and coins (points)
- [ ] Make instructions at the top of the screen (STILL NEED TO DO)
- [x] Make controls for user fish
- [x] Upload other imagery into game (make turtles for sharks and coins)

For Monday: -- Fingers Crossed! 
- [ ] Make sharks come out from the right hand side of the screen
- [ ] Make coins come out from the right hand side of the screen
- [ ] Begin to work on Lives system - watch dictionary video
- [ ] Make UI that appears when user hits button (will work on pause associated with this later)
- [ ] Set up space for instructions at top of screen (don't know exactly what format for lives and if levels will appear so hold off on too much detail

To be Scheduled:
- [ ] Make point system (I know that there are other aspects that go into this, haven't encountered yet to break down)
- [ ] Make lives system (I know that there are other aspects that go into this, haven't encountered yet to break down)
- [ ] Make UI that comes up with spacebar (I know that there are other aspects that go into this, haven't encountered yet to break down)
- [ ] Make it so that user can pause the game to look at instructions - part of UI (maybe one button to pause, separate button to UI)
- [ ] Make it so that different levels in the game result in different computer interaction (faster/more frequent sharks/coins)
- [ ] Scoreboard to pop up at end of game
- [ ] User can press button to quit game
- [ ] Make it so that when the fish and the coin/shark hit the same range of coordinates, the game recognizes this

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Animated background that looks more like a reef
- [ ] 3 levels of game play


My game looks very similar to the way that it looked yesterday during class. I didn't have a free moment to stop and work on the project as there's a lot happening in my life right now outside of class, but I am going to work more tonight and devote a massive amount of time to the project over the weekend. I do have my user fish working how I want it to though! And I've created all of my turtle shapes. Tonight, I'm going to work on making it so that the shark turtles appear from the right hand side of the screen. I'm also looking forward to my cultural coding experience this weekend with GirlDevelopIt and am excited to learn more about what other people do with coding outside of UNC.
