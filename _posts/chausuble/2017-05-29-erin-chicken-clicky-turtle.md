I never knew coloring a chicken could go so wrong...

My first thought was to make a "coloring book" turtle with the clicky function. First, I made a chicken drawing, then, I broke the coloring down into parts.
I thought that would be hard enough - probably the biggest problem was that I couldn't figure out how to get exact x and y
logical statements for coloring in each body part. That's when a more mathy solution would be the answer, but I didn't have
time/energy to go into all of that.

When I made a trinket for each individual section, they worked as I wanted them to. But now I've run into a huge problem: 
for some reason, clicking on each area now just calls the specific part of setup() where it draws the body. Bigger
problem: This keeps happening even when I made a duplicate copy that deleted every trace of setup where it draws the body!!
Let's keep working on this...
