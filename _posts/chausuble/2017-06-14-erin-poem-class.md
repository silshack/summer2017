title: "Erin's Final Project Part 1"

I was pinched for time last night, so I grabbed my turtle for the poetry slam since that looked easiest to work with, and pretty
much made a brand-new class for all of my poem-writing functions. It was pretty cool to see it work out, actually, and it looks
great for organizing a bunch of functions and variables into one module, and easily calling functions. Whille I don't feel
confident that I 100% understand classes, at least I made it work out in two trinkets, so I think I'll at least be able to
check off that requirement for our final project when the time comes.

This is the poetry turtle:

As I thought it over last night, I knew how I could use it for my final project. Pretty quickly, I managed to make a small class
for one of my monsters in the game. That way, I don't have to make a dictionary of dictionaries to hold all of their values, which
is easier for me to understand.

Here is the monster turtle:
