Ugh, Github freaked out on me and crashed my browser when I tried to submit this post for the first time this morning. Then I
did it again later, where I thought it submitted the pull request but it didn't, so that took out all of my notes. I'm just 
going to make this short.

I was pinched for time last night, so I just took my poetry slam turtle, and put all of the poem writing functions into a single
class. That worked, so I left it at that. Then, in the morning, I decided to test out implementing classes with my final project
by making a class for a monster that can be used in my game. I saw how useful they can be to organize all of my functions and
variables without using dicitonaries within dictionaries or big, complicated modules. I'm still not 100% sure I understand classes, 
but I've managed to make them work twice without breaking the program, so I think I can implement them into my final project 
and satisfy that requirement.
