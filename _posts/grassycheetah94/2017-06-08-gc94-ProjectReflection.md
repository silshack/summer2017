Caroline Hall's Drawing App:
The first thing that stands out is how well Caroline organized her code. It is short and easy to understand with descriptive 
comments. She accomplished all of the projects goals while keeping it clear and concise. Her user interface is very clean and easy to figure out, and was very easy to use and draw distinct pieces of art with. 

Much like her code, her milestones were very clearly stated. They were acheiveable and sufficient to satisfy the project requirements. She started off, much like me, figuring out her keystroke code. Unlike me, she chose only to include colors in the keystrokes, but this made it very easy for the user. She then focused on creating a clear menu at the bottom of the page that made it very easy for the user to understand how to effectively use her app. She then worked on the actual app developing the different logical arguements that she needed to code in order to have her app work seemlessly. The process of first deciding what to do, telling the user how to use her app, and then making the app user friendly was a great way to go about the project. She didnt bring up many challenges, but does state that using two turtles did help her, so there was obviously some bumps along the road, which is to be expected. 

Self Reflection:
Caroline's process was much like my own. Her process of first deciding what to do, telling the user how to use her app, and then making the app user friendly was very much like how I set up my milestones. The code was also very similar. The biggest difference is that she made an almost entirely click based app whereas I made an entirely keystroke based app. I think my biggest take away and what I can learn from her is how to create and write very clear and concise code. I was worried that adding click based code would mess with the user friendliness of the program but she combines keystrokes and clicking beautifully. I liked almost everything she did. I was great to use and great to look at. My biggest issue would be no way of picking up the pen. I see white as a way of erasing not necessary picking up the pen. 

Evaluating myself:
I accomplished the app requirements and went beyond them. I think I created an easy to use, easy to look at app that can actually be used to draw on a computer. My biggest regret is not adding a click based system as well as the arrow keys to make my program as comprehensive as possible. 

```python
Although it looked great yesterday and was working perfectly, when I tried to run it on my computer today, it shut down everytime like it had just run through the code, no errors were reported though. It might just be my computer
