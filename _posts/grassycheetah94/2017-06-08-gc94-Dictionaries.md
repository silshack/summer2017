title: "Thomas Newlin's Take on Dictionaries"
---

After learning about them in class today here is my understanding of dictionaries. From my understanding dictionaries are a lot like lists but with cooler features. One of those features is keys. To me keys are just like names of the individual items in a list and instead of calling upon an item you can call upon a key instead. This makes it easier to call upon an item in code and more readable. Also when created through loops and not manually made, the keys and values are added to the dictionary in no particular order or reason. Overall, my take away is that dictionaries are very useful if in the rest of your code you need to call upon the individual items inside. 

Here is the code we wrote today:
