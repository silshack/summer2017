I struggled on how to start this exercise. Eventually I thought of the bright idea of commenting out the print lines to figure out what was doing what in the code. This lead me to be able to narrow down the vast lists of lists and lists of dictionaries into one item. I eventually printed the type, longitude, latitude, and the name of the place.
