Reflection:
It wasnt too hard of an assignment. My biggest lightbulb came when trying to actually enter the data into my user created file I had a for loop opened and the closed function inside the for loop, which was closing my file and it could not add all of the lines to the file. I was unable to achieve opening the file although this is something that I look forward to learning about today in class as people show their creative ways of accomplishing this achievement.
