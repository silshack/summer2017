My Final Project Idea: Football Kick Return Game
I used to play computer games all of the time and I want to create a game in which players can use a user controled "player" (imported pic) has to dodge enemy players and make it to the endzone in order to level up. Each level will have more players to beat and smaller spaces to squeeze through. I hope to make it very visually pleasing, as well as addicting to play. 
```python
-Stage 1-
Create a football field, using the background color and turtle pen/stamps, and "players", using turtles shaped like Piskel drawings
-Stage 2-
Create gameplay using keystrokes (possibly including powerups)
-Stage 3- 
Create a basic constantly available help dialog (Including instructions)/ Begining menu that uses clicks
-Stage 4-
Create 3 Levels that increase in difficulty by adding more players and hopefully more skilled, faster players
-Stage 5-
Create a scoreboard/level achievement at the top of the screen. 
-Stage 6-
Make a winning/losing screen (Posisbly using Piskel)
-Stage 7-
Edit/Make user friendly
-Stage 8-
If possible, create powerups that increase speed, spin move, and maybe some sort of hurdle.
```
