My Final Project Idea: Football Kick Return Game
I used to play computer games all of the time and I want to create a game in which players can use a user controled "player" (imported pic) has to dodge enemy players and make it to the endzone in order to level up. Each level will have more players to beat and smaller spaces to squeeze through. I hope to make it very visually pleasing, as well as addicting to play. 
```python
Step 1-
Create the field and "players"
Step 2- 
Create a "constantly available help dialog"/Begining menu (clicks)
Step 3-
Create gameplay using keystrokes (possibly including powerups)
Step 4-
Create Levels
Step 5-
Create a scoreboard/level achievement
Step 6-
Make a winning screen
Step 7-
Edit/Make user friendly
```
