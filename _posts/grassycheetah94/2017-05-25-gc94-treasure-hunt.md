Reflections:

This was easily the most difficult assignment so far. Figuring out how to make this game my own was difficult and challenging. Multiple times I had to step away or sleep on my problems. Im still confused about the darker concept. I will definitely be asking questions about what many of these steps actually mean. I had multiple light bulbs but I am still confused about many of the concepts.
