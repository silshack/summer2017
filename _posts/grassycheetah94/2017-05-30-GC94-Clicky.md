Here's a link to my code:

Reflections:

This was one of my favorite excersises to date. I wish I had spent more time on it becuase it couldve been really really cool but I am happy with what I created. Basically it is a treasure hunt with added features. The animations were really fun to play with and eventually I decided on a turtle that was "lost" at sea. Therefore, I made the background look like the open ocean with a sun and cloudless sky. When the click finds "land" a picture of an island pops up. I hand many lightbulb moments but am still yet to find my lightbulb moment for ending the game. I tried using the same code as before but it failed and also tried to use many other variations but they too failed. I am excited to get to class to officially end the game.
