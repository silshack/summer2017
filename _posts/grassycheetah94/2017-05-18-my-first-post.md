My name is Thomas Newlin. I was born and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana and recently graduated from Indiana University. 
I am a graduate student in the Biomedical and Health Informatics program here at the University of North Carolina.
I love sports and although not a Heels fan yet, Im sure I will find my way to many Carolina games this year. 
...Always code at 75 mph...
