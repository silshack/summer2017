Reflection:
I decided to go back to my speaking man exercise code to complete the class exercise. I decided this becuase I knew I used multiple turtles and could extend the turtle class. I decided to make an EllTurtle class extension that created two pink ovals whenever a new turtle is created. It was useful in this code because it created the man's ears. My struggles came when I forgot to put that the new class could do anything and listen to anything normal turtles can. This delayed my success and I even had to walk away for a little before it popped into my head that that could be the problem.
