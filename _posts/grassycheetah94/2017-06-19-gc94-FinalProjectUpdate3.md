Reflection: I moved from two houses into one full time apartment this weekend. I was forced to go to Charlotte to accomplish this and that unfortunately limited my time I had to work on my project. I did however figure out how to build a constantly avaliable menu that I can easily build onto if I add extra features that I have to explain to the user. I plan on building an enemy engine to actually be able to tackle the user hopefully by tonight. Im excited to actually put in some work.
