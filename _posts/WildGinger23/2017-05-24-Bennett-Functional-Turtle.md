Below I've embedded my custom turtle, it is the original turtle I duplicated,

Reflection

It seemed obvious to me to take my custom turtle and make some of my code into commands. Specifically the "Orders Recieved!" text seemed like something that could be appear more often then I originally had it.
Some difficulties I had with this were that I initially tried to copy and paste my definitions of functions at earlier places in my code. This made some problems for me, as the color and goto commands were interupted.
The problems mostly had to do with states, so I had to be careful to read over what I was writing and trying to do.
