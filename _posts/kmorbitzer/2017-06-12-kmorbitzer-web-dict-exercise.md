Below is my reflection:
For this exercise, I found that when given a lot of data organized in a complex dictionary and/or lists, itâ€™s possible to sort through the data to retrieve the data thought important in a legible format.  It was iterative process to see how the data was formatted, and then was able to figure out the correct format.
