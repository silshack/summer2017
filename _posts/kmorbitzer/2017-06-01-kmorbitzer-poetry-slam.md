Here's my code:

Here's my reflection:
The poetry slam tina exercise was easier for me to complete than the clicky turtles exercise.  I first created a function to be able to write the poetry lines across the page and used a while loop to be able to add additional lines of poetry.  I was also able to allow the user to enter additional lines of text than are on the screen and if the user enters more than 35 characters on a line, the remaining characters will go to the next line.  There werenâ€™t any major points of frustration with this exercise.  I think I was more relieved to be able to tackle this after creating a tic-tac-toe game for my last exercise.
