Here's my code:

Here's my reflection:
The treasure hunt turtles exercise was very challenging for me.  I was able to modify the code to get user input and give the user feedback on how close they are to the treasure.  However, I struggled with being able to incorporate bad inputs.  I ended up having to make two functions that would prompt the user to enter a numeric value between -100 and 100 if a bad input was entered.  Also, I wanted to test my code several times throughout to make sure that what I created worked, so it took some time to win the game several times.  I realized that I should have just put in a print command stating where the treasure was at line 73, which would then have made my testing easier if I knew where the treasure was located.
