Below is my code for the 3 exercises:

Below is my reflection:
I am unable to attend class on June 6th so I had to complete the regular expressions exercises on my own.  These exercises took me a while to complete.  With the first exercise, I had to use a while loop and “in” to be able to count how many times the term appears that the program is searching for.  I was able to use some of this basic logic then to help complete exercise 2.  Exercise 3 took the longest to complete and I was proud when I was finally able to get the tables to appear separated.
