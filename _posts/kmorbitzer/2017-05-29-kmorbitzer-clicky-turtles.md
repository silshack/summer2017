Here's my code:

Below is my reflection:
For the clicky turtles exercise, I created a game of tic-tac-toe that will fill in the space that is clicked on the board.  This program ended up being a lot more difficult to create than I originally thought.  
I first drew the tic-tac-toe board, which consisted of a series of basic turtle commands.  Even though it took a little while to get the board correct, that ended up being the easiest part by far.  I ended up having to create separate functions to determine which player’s turn it was, marking an x or o in the correct spot, and working through all of the different combinations to determine if a player won.  It took a lot of time and testing to get it right, which was frustrating at the time, but now it’s fun to play using the program that I created.
