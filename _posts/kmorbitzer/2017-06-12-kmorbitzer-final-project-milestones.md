For my final project, I’m going to be using the tic-tac-toe game already started.  The milestones are below:
•	Incorporate a draw game into the code
•	Implement levels of difficulty
  o	First level will be normal play
  o	Second level will have a piece erased using the random number generator so that on ¼ turns, a piece will be erased
  o	Third level will have a piece erased using the random number generator so that 1/3 turns, a piece will be erased
  o	I will also incorporate the key events into the levels of difficulty by having the user key which level they want to play
•	A score tracker that is updated every time a game is played will need to be incorporated
•	A custom image will need to be incorporated
•	A custom turtle class will need to be incorporated
•	A win screen and an end screen will need to be incorporated
•	A help dialog needs to be incorporated
