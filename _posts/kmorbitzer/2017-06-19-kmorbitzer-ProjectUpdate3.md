For my final project, I’m going to be using the tic-tac-toe game already started.  The milestones are below:
•	Incorporate a draw game into the code 
•	Implement levels of difficulty
o	First level will be normal play
o	Second level will have a piece erased using the random number generator so that on ¼ turns, a piece will be erased
o	Third level will have a piece erased using the random number generator so that 1/3 turns, a piece will be erased
o	I will also incorporate the key events into the levels of difficulty by having the user key which level they want to play
•	A score tracker that is updated every time a game is played will need to be incorporated
•	A custom image will need to be incorporated
•	A custom turtle class will need to be incorporated
•	A win screen and an end screen will need to be incorporated
•	A help dialog needs to be incorporated
Project update: I was having a lot of difficulty getting the board to clear and re-draw correctly to start a new game.  The issue ended up being how the turtle was facing when the previous game ended.  I was finally able to change up the code to get the new board to draw correctly.  Additionally, I added in code to keep a running score of Player 1 total wins, Player 2 total wins, and draw games.

Project update – 6.19.17: I got a lot of progress done on my program over the weekend.  I have essentially incorporated all of the requirements, which was needed since it is difficult for me to spend considerable time working on the program during the week.  One area of difficulty that I had was adjusting the size of an image.  An image that I originally incorporated into the program took up the whole screen when it was called.  I tried different methods to try to reduce the side, but none ended up working.  Therefore, I ended up incorporating a smaller, different image.
