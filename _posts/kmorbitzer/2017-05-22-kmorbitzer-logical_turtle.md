My reflection:
This program was challenging for me to create.  I first had to decide what program to make, and I decided to make something that incorporated creating circles that could grow in diameter.  The variables, inputs, and conditional statements didn’t give me any issues when I though through how to write them.  I found a loop command that would allow each variable to increase depending on the value entered.  A difficult aspect was getting the circles to align inside of each other.  That took some trial and error with the tina functions.
The program was fun to make, however challenging.  One concern that I have with the course is the time commitment with the accelerated nature and whether I can keep up while working full-time.  It’s going to be a challenging month!
