Here's the program I'm embedding.

Here's my reflection.

For my Turtle program, I decided to create a castle.  This allowed me to continue to use many of the skills that we previously learned, as well as find new ways to apply them.  

To start creating the program, I first drew out what I wanted it to ultimately look like.  I then moved the starting point for the castle down from 0,0 to give enough room to build the tower with the flags.  I started by building the left tower first with the triangles, then moved over to the right tower.  After building the castle with the two towers, I next moved onto adding the door and windows.  In order to create the door, I had to first make a circle and color it in black, then create a rectangle over the circle.  By also coloring that in black, it makes both shapes appear to be one.  I then created the windows in a similar way, only on a smaller scale.  I created the flags last, starting with the ones on the left tower and then finishing with the ones on the right tower.  

One of the biggest challenges for me in creating this Turtle program was making sure everything was symmetrical by keeping everything the same height.  I would often have to look back at my previous code to remember how high up I made the tower, the window, and the flags to make sure that I made the ones on the other side the same height.  This made me recognize that I need to come up with a process to keep track of this more efficiently and that I should label the code around certain objects as Iâ€™m writing it.
