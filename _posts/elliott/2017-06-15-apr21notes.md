# Q&A


# Project Update 2

You know the drill.  This time, **use your snapshots**.

* Pair up
* Merge up
* Stand up (not literally)

During standup:

* What did you say you'd do?
* What did you actually do?
* Show and tell your program
* What will you do for next class?
* Any problems?

After everyone's done their update, revise your milestones (in your existing post) and **get your partner to merge your revisions**.
