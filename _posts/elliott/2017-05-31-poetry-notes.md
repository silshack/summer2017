# Q & A

* [Turtletalk example](https://trinket.io/python/a49153e12a) - A first step towards accessible Turtle for all

# Pair Programming Review

*"Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so. - See more [here](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html)"*

* Communication is key!  Think out loud.  Work your partner into your thought process.
* Pair programming may feel slower.  That's natural.  Slow down and buy in to get the benefits.
* The Navigator can't get anywhere without the driver.
* The Driver doesn't know where to go without the navigator.
* Tell your partner what you need from them.  Ask them for it!

# Looking Ahead: Drawing App / Blackjack Game Due June 7

# Pair up & Make a Name For Yourself

Our class website runs off of a config file.  Time to tell us who you are (or want to be known as).

Reminder: your public activities in this class can be pseudonymous if you want them to be.
