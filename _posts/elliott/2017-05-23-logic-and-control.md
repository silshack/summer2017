# Logistics

Moving forward, you'll review and merge each others' work in class.

Review, fix, and close issues assigned to you. We'll have some catch-up time where
we can review any outstanding issues.

Gittr chat.

# Merging!

With great power comes great responsibility

* Never merge your own pull request
* Never commit directly to the `gh-pages` branch

* Never merge broken or failing code

# Review & Merge Posts

Volunteer: Merging with Tommy Tester.

* Reviewing PRs - comment on them directly
* Merging - Your responsibility to make sure your partner's post works! Check that it shows up on our site
* Assigning issues - already merged work with problems


~10 minutes reviewing & merging posts with a partner.

# Discussion: Logic and the Flow of Control

Boolean values are very simple but very powerful.  There are tons of useful ways to 
construct **expressions** that evaluate to `True` or `False` in Python, and we use these
to change the behavior of our program. 

Basic `if` statements act as 'gates' to control whether blocks of code get executed.
`elif` and `else` statements enhance this control.
