<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/03dfabddb0" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice: no `i = 0`, no `while` loops, and no `range()` needed.  Lots of `for` loops and, to get fancy, `.join()`ing around a `"\t"`.

In short, slice out the rows you want, `for` loop over them, and *do something* with each row.
