# Q&A

- should you ever merge your own pull request?
- Major project labels: thanks for the help, but let me label them so I can keep track

Some stuff having to do with Jekyll:

- Markdown lists and such.  In general, use lots of empty lines to make sure our markdown
parser gets things right (I make this mistake too).
- Filename collisions.  Give your file a unique title (after the date part)

Some App stuff:

- Attributes for specific turtles to make buttons

# App clinic June 6th, 5-6:30pm

Stay after class for help with your Blackjack or Drawing apps.

# Looking ahead: Games!

Your second project is due before spring break: make a Game app using Turtle.
Thursday you'll have miletones, we'll do an in-class peer clinic, but there will
be no snapshot or peer review this time.  Everything should be pretty familiar!

Think of this as more of a 'game sketch' like I describe in the video than a full
featured game.  If you choose to make a game for your final you can do all the bells
and whistles.




# Python 3

We'll be using Python 3 in Trinket for all text-based work.  Remember your `print()` functions.

`sep=" "` lets you specify what the seperator between arguments is.  It defaults to a space.

`end='\n'` lets you specify what to do at the end of the print functin.  It defaults to a newline.

You can make anonymous Python 3 trinkets on Trinket for free.  If you want the convenience of saving your
Python 3 trinkets to your account, you can use code `inls560` to get our premium plan at a huge discount of
two bucks a month.

When we start running Python on Cloud 9, remember to type `python3` instead of `python`.

# Files

There are a few core actions you should be able to perform on files:

* Open them (Dr. Chuck)
* Search/extract information from them (Dr. Chuck)
* Build a data structure from them (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Explore your data (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Print a table from your data (not Dr. Chuck)

We'll do all of these today.

Something Dr. Chuck didn't cover: the `with` statement.  This is the Pythonic way to open a file:

```python
with open("sales.csv") as file:
  sales_raw = file.read()
  # Or, if you need lines:
  sales_lines = file.readlines()
```

Otherwise you'll have to open and close the file handler and it's a pain.

# Lists of Lists

Making a list full of lists gives you some interesting powers.  First, you can think of each item in
the main list as a row and each item in the interior lists as a cell/column.  As long as you keep the lengths
constant you've got what amounts to a spreadsheet, but in Python!

Here's how you can visualize a list of lists:

```
[ [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...] ]
```

This one has five rows and three columns.

To work with lists of lists you'll nee lots of **slicing** and **indexing**.  Remember the `list[x:y:z]` syntax.

Let's get to work!  I recommend you read over questions 1-3 briefly and then go straight to exercise 4.  Let me orient you briefly.
