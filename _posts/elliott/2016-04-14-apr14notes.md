# Q&A 

* Cloud 9 peeps: [https://community.c9.io/t/writing-a-python-app/1609](https://community.c9.io/t/writing-a-python-app/1609)
* The `#!/usr/bin/python` tells the Run button what to use to run the file.  You should pick `/usr/bin/python3` instead so you're using Python 3.  Here's the file I ran:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

print("Hello World!")
```

* OR you can also save your file and type `python3 filename.py` in a terminal (you may need to `cd` if it's in a directory).  This is what I do.

# Analysts

Check this example code for the kind of text-based interface I'm looking for:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/b5c5eced6a" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can use functions to respond to the options, or you could store the choice in a variable that's 
passed to one function that changes its behavior based on logic you write.

You'll need to get your dataset inside the function, either as a parameter or as a global.

# Turtlers

Remember my video?  There's a chapter on using dictionaries in Turtle!

There's also an example game with levels (but that may not apply to anyone except Jay).

# Permanent Groups

TBD, in case anyone switched.

# Group Work today:

A revised project plan.  See in-class exercise.
