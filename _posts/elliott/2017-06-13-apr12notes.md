# Q&A

- A few final project updates, in bold on the assignments list.  Nothing new, just stuff I forgot
- A few 'lift-off' sightings on the homework!  Awesome.  APIs are great and this class only begis to do them justice.
- In my gradebook, one or two entries of "Half-ass".  You reap what you sow, learners!

# Cowsays: APIs are cool

What is the structure (schema) of the request?  [Read the docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#GeocodingResponses).
Why didn't I give you a link to the docs?

# Dict Review

Make a dict

```
mydict = { }
mydict = dict()
mydict = { "key" : "value" }
```

Get a value

```
mydict["key"]
# returns "value"
```

Dict of dicts

```
# set "key" value equal to empty dict from the start
mydict = { "key" : {} }

# OR if dict already exists set "key" equal to empty dict this way:
mydict["key"] = {}

# put a value in the inner dict
mydict["key"]["inner key"] = "inner value"
```

In our homework there was a dict of lists of dicts with lists of dicts oh my!  When you encouter this stuff,
go back to home base: `print` & `type` to learn more.

# Final Projects Brainstorms

Initial split: Data anlaysis & Turtle.  Pick whichever one it'd be helpful to talk about if you're on the fence.

Data analysis people: Start with Data Scatergories

Go around, state your proposed project, and work with the group to critique and strengthen it.  Ask questions of each other!
