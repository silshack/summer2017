# Files

Here's my solution for the exercies:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/03dfabddb0" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice: no `i = 0`, no `while` loops, and no `range()` needed.  Lots of `for` loops and, to get fancy, `.join()`ing around a `"\t"`.

In short, slice out the rows you want, `for` loop over them, and *do something* with each row.

# Set Up Git

Git is what we've been using underneath github, we just didn't know it.  Having access to it on the command line will make you uber powerful!

Your homework over the weekend is to use the command line to make edits to your posts when they have formatting problems and otherwise generally clean up your posts in a way that isn't practical on github.

Also, welcome to the command line.

# Guests!

Welcome Sylvia Pellicore and Thu Mai Christian.
