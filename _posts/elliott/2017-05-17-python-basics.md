But programs can also be very simple, and we'll start simple.

# Your First Python Program

Programs are composed of small pieces.  In this class you'll learn about the pieces and then put the pieces together to form more and more complex programs.  Our first in-class 
exercise will take you from drawing a simple line to making more complex drawings.  This will prepare you for your first homework, which is to use what we learn in class
and online resources to make a drawing.
