# Q&A

- Phew!  We're done with non-final related exercises!

# Classhack review

Pair up & Merge up.  Any questions?  Get them answered now.

# Analysts

Check this example code for the kind of text-based interface I'm looking for:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/b5c5eced6a" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can use functions to respond to the options, or you could store the choice in a variable that's
passed to one function that changes its behavior based on logic you write.

You'll need to get your dataset inside the function, either as a parameter or as a global.

# Turtlers

Remember my video?  There's a chapter on using dictionaries in Turtle!

There's also an example game with levels (but that may not apply to anyone except Jay).

# Permanent Groups

TBD, in case anyone switched.

# Group Work today:

A revised project plan.  See in-class exercise.
