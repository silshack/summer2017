# Take home, ungraded Mid-term

This is exactly the same as the other section of INLS 560.  Completing it will get you full credit, and knowing
your numerical grade should give you a sense of whether you've gotten some of the basics.

This is something that you should treat like a real test to get the most out of.  Review **Syntax**, **flow of control**,
and **loops** in particular.  Trinket does a lot for you in terms of autocomplete and error detection but this will
be a paper test with no feedback so make sure you're not too reliant on those crutches.  It is open notes and open book
but I encourage you to try it closed notes and closed book.

# Dictionaries

Dictionaries are like simple mini databases.  They're great at keeping track of statistics.

Today we'll use **dictionaries of dictionaries** that will let you store and retrieve multiple stats about a state. This
is a core data analysis skill.


# Dictionary exercises today

We'll spend the whole class working **individually** on your homework.  I'm here. Use me.
