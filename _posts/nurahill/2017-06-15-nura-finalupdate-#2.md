So here are my updated milestones:

- [X] Create a cool/appropriate background
- [X] Add movable monkey image
- [ ] Add a score
- [ ] Add a timer
- [ ] Hide bananas
- [ ] Display what level you are on
- [ ] Create winning screen
- [ ] Create looser screen
- [ ] Add music?

Last night I started with the actual coding for my game, which is great because lately i've just been focusing on desiging the images. One thing i realized was that I wont be using my drawing app as a starting point. I just started it from scratch, and I feel good about that decision. 

As i am writing this, i just noticed that I somehow errased all of my code that i did yesterday..... oh my Gooooshhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am so bummed right now. 

So, what i did do, was add the background image and added a monkey, and created a dictionary, I made a class for banana and snake, created variables for score, game state, timer.

I FOUND (part of) IT!!!!!!!!

What I am showing here is kind of messed up. I am slowly working on it. I need to re-do the images, but for update-sake, i wanted to show something off. Hopefully by monday I will have a good chunk of it done. my goal is to have the movable monkey going, and to also work on getting a help menu of some sort. I would also like to add a timer and the other levels to it all by monday.
