title: "Nura's Drawing App Reflection"
---


I love Ayesha's drawing assignment. Although she experienced some confusion as to what she should have been focused on, and was not able to make her app do what she wanted, probably due to time constraints, it certainly says a lot about a person when they are able to be honest about their struggles and lay it all out there. Her reflection explains her process and the ups and downs she encountered, which i find to be incredibly valuable. Python is not easy by any means, and certainly not easy to learn in a few weeks, so I give Ayesha many props for getting up there and saying "this is what I can do guys, and this is where i am at!". I believe its equally as valuable as presenting amazing coding skills.

She succeeded in many thigs: 
making her modules, having more than one turtle do something, being creative and making due with the time she had, good commenting, the code is organized, she is using functions, and the code works. 

Some things that could be improved with some more time: 
making it so the user can have more drawing ability, run without errors (when i tried it, some of the shapes were not appearing in the right place, like the roof would be drawn beside the house, rather than above. This could have been my mistake however!).

When it comes to her milestones, she was able to clearly define them. She also included a 'revised milestones list', which mentioned what she would like to improve on. I think that i really liked her honesty about her struggle, because i feel like there might be a lot of people who are having the same anxieties (like me :) but who don’t say anything about it. That to me was the most valuable thing.

I personally feel like I had many things to improve on as well. I did not do modules like she did, and I feel as though she did a great job when it comes aesthetically designing her code so it looks nice, and that is an aspect i could have improved more on. I think that I did ok. I don’t necessarily really feel proud of the work. I feel like I always have an emotional reaction when I am coding. I always find it daunting and just difficult to get started.  I do feel like some people have a more natural inclination towards these things, and I feel like I just don’t. Coding just takes so long for me, it’s at times overwhelming because we are moving so quickly. Like I mentioned in my previous post, with more time maybe I could have done more things, to make it look more professional, and do some of the other things that I was supposed to do (like making modules).
