Here is the embeded link to my functional turtle:

Here is a link embeded with my nonfuctional turtle:

I had an ok time doing the argument. In my original turtle I had writen out code to draw 3 stars, therefore there was a lot of repetition. I made a function where I defined a patern for a star then called it 3 times to make the drawing. I changed the coordinates to make them appear where i wanted them. I realized how by defining my own functions, i can cut out a lot of extra code. I had a really hard time thinking of a return function. so I came up with, what looks like a valid return, however it seems totally non-functional. 
```
#variable
star = input("how many stars do you see?")
#custome function argument that takes returns
def starcheck():
  if star == 3:
    return("False!")
  else: 
    return("Correct!")
````

I could not think of how to make this work in a purposeful way. I am hoping we will talk about this in class.
