I decided to use one of my starts from a previous turtle exercise and turn it into a class. instead of having it always draw a 5 pointed star, i made it so the user can choose the number of points, color, and size. I could not figure out how to make the turtle move once it draws a star, meaning that if i do multiple stars they are drawn on top of each other. I also tried to figure out how to map the star objects to a screen click, and i could not figure out how to make that work either. 

Here is my code:
