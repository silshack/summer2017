title: "Nura's Final First Milestones"
---

For my final project, i will be using my drawing app as the beginning structure for my code, and I plan to build on it to morph it into something very different. The game will have 3 levels of difficulty. The user will have to help the monkey find the hidden bananas.  In the 1st round, the user will have 30 seconds to find 5 bananas. The 2nd round the user will have 30 secs to find 8 bananas, and the 3rd and final round the user will have 30 secs to find 10 bananas. The three levels will look the same, however, the 1st level will have a sunrise, 2nd a sun up, and 3rd night time (moon). I want to have a winning screen and a loser screen. I also would like to have a timer and score show up. I would love it if I could add music to it, but I have no idea if it’s possible. 

Milestones:

- [ ] Create a cool/appropriate background
- [ ] Add movable monkey image
- [ ] Add a score
- [ ] Add a timer
- [ ] Hide bananas
- [ ] Display what level you are on
- [ ] Create winning screen
- [ ] Create looser screen
- [ ] Add music?

The timing for each level and the number of bananas the monkey must find are all things that will maybe change. Once I put it together I will be able to tell what feels best. I want the game to make people feel nervous and rushed to find the bananas, and I think I’ll have a better idea of what that might be like once I am nearly done.
