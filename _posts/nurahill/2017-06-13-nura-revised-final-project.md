---

Before todays class I intended to draw a really cool intricate backround resembling a jungle. Once I got started I realized that it would take me for ever. When we were in our groups I noticed a few people using Piskel to draw up things to add to their code, so I then decided to just draw a jungle scene in piskel and add it my background. As of right now I have not added the image to trinket, but i plan on doing this tomorrow! since i drew my background in piskel, I have also decided to not 'hide' the bananas, but rather for the banana to be drawn when the user clicks on the right place.

Milestones:

[x] Create a cool/appropriate background
[ ] Add movable monkey image
[ ] Add a score
[ ] Add a timer
[ ] Hide bananas
[ ] Display what level you are on
[ ] Create winning screen
[ ] Create looser screen
[ ] Add music?
