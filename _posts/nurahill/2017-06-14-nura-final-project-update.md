So here are my milestones from yesterday:

Milestones:

- [ ] Create a cool/appropriate background
- [ ] Add movable monkey image
- [ ] Add a score
- [ ] Add a timer
- [ ] Hide bananas
- [ ] Display what level you are on
- [ ] Create winning screen
- [ ] Create looser screen
- [ ] Add music?

After trying to draw my background image as a jungle scene with turtle, I realized after doing all this for a rectangle:
```

#background design:
tina.speed(7)
tina.penup()
#tina.color("black")
tina.right(90)
tina.forward(180)
tina.right(90)
tina.pendown()
tina.fill(True)
tina.color("firebrick")
tina.forward(200)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(30)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(400)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(30)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(200)
tina.fill(False)
```
that most of my time would be taken up by drawing. as i mentioned in my last post, since we dont have a lot of time, i have decided to use piskel to make all of my images. so that is what i am working on. 

I ralized today that i also need to design intermediate backgrounds, and winner and loser backgrounds. I thought about finding a monkey image and using that, but i think i will draw him as well. I will also try and add sounds, like if the monkey finds a banana i want to have some sort of sund affect. I will know if i will actually do that later, when i find out how complicated that is.

Here is my duplicate:

I havent really done anything to it as of right now, because i've been drawing and designing in piskel. my goal for tonight is to get started with coding, so i have something to show tomorrow, i would definitely like to add my images tonight. I feel as thought I could potentially be too ambitious with what i want to do, so i am worried about that, but i feel like i will get a better undertanding once i start coding tonight.
