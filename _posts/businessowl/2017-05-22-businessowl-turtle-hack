Here's the program I'm embedding:

I started out making a photoshop icon, and I was going to draw some background designs around it. Then I realized while drawing the box shape for the Photoshop icon that I could just draw a bunch of boxes to make a big grid across the screen. I could then fill in the boxes of that grid to display some retro pixel art, like a Mario character or something. Then I thought, why stop there? Actual pictures are nothing but a ton of pixels, so if I could extract color values from a real image, I could fill in the grid with those color values and have something that looks like a real image. I found a PHP function that extracts color values from images, and I just used nested for loops in PHP to write python code to draw a grid with those color values. My code is included for your viewing. It takes forever to draw, so I've included a link below with a preview image of the final result.
