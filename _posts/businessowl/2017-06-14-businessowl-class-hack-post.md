<strong>Reflection:</strong>
<br/>
<a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html" target="_blank">This reading</a> was great for explaining classes. Starting off, I did not know at all how to set up classes in python or how you were allowed to refer to things. But after doing that reading, I figured out how to set up an init function, create a method, call a method from within the class AND externally, import the class into another file, and instantiate an object. I believe that adding a class to my Poetry Slam trinket made it very readable and certainly helped me work through how to create a class before I do so in my final project. A cool tip that I figured out that I did not see in the reading was that if you want to call a method from within the class itself, you can say:
```
self.whatever_method_you_want()
```
Honestly, I did think that integrating classes into an existing python program would be complicated, but I was able to work through it and learn a lot about how to set up classes in the process.
