Reflection:
  Having completed the Computepay and Computegrade exercises before starting this, I already had a grasp on creating and using functions. The process of creating and implementing the functions was simple and straight for with little work neccessary. I only encountered a problem when I tried to create an If statement that took input and got back a "Bad 'Input'" error. This was fixed after I rewrote the same code. No idea what happened, but it works.
