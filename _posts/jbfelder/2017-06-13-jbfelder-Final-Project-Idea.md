<strong>Proposal:</strong>
For my Final Project I plan to implement Goggle Maps API, a Weather API, and a text to speech function that will be able to take a location, find out the number of day a certain temperature has been reached that month (on a scale of 10's such as 70's, 80's, etc.) as well as the upcoming 3-5 day forecast, compile the data in accordance with the project rules (histogram), but will also have text to speech to inform the user of the average, max, min, etc. temperatures. All information given will be exclusive to the location that the user inputs. I also plan to have some conditions that will playfully suggest what the User should wear today/tomorrow.

Having worked with different APIs before, I like combining them together in different ways to achieve certain results. I imagine that this will be a neat program for allowing users to "quickly" check their local temperatures and make decisions from there. The reason that I hope to include a text to speech API is due to the fact that I have worked with kids who have some sort of visual impairment and know about the struggles that they face each day. By creating this project, I can expand upon it outside of the classroom and create an interface in which all may enjoy, whether they have a visual impairment or not.
