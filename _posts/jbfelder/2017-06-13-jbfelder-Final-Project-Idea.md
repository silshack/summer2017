title: "Justyn Felder's Final Project Idea"

</br>
<strong>Proposal:</strong>
For my Final Project I plan to implement Goggle Maps API, a Weather API, and a Text to Speech function that will be able to take a location, find out the number of day a certain temperature has been reached that month (on a scale of 10's such as 70's, 80's, etc.) as well as the upcoming 3-5 day forecast, compile the data in accordance with the project rules (histogram), but will also have text to speech to inform the user of the average, max, min, etc. temperatures. All information given will be exclusive to the location that the user inputs. I also plan to have some conditions that will playfully suggest what the User should wear today/tomorrow.
</br>
</br>
Having worked with different APIs before, I like combining them together in different ways to achieve certain results. I imagine that this will be a neat program for allowing users to "quickly" check their local temperatures and make decisions from there. The reason that I hope to include a text to speech API is due to the fact that I have worked with kids who have some sort of visual impairment and know about the struggles that they face each day. By creating this project, I can expand upon it outside of the classroom and create an interface in which all may enjoy, whether they have a visual impairment or not.

<strong>Current Milestones:</strong>
</br>
Implement Google Maps API / Find a Weather API and implement it / Find a Text to Speech function for Python / Make certain results can be pulled and/or established from each / Combine in different way to make sure they can work together / Begin setting up so certain data can be pulled from certain areas / Set limits if needed / Input temps in a dictionary / Get counts set / Create Histogram / Give results / Allow results to be outputted with Text to Speech / Give "suggestions" / Allow "replayability
</br>
</br>
<strong>Revised Milestones</strong>
For 6/13:

- [ ] Setup API and API-Key so data may be taken from a location
- [ ] From the location inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has
- [ ] Create user input so user is able to to decide on location while program is running
- [ ] From the location the user inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has

To Be Determined:

- [ ] Show all available data from a certain date
- [ ] Make program inform(print) out the next days forecast
- [ ] Show all available data from a range of dates
- [ ] From all data available, show only temperature (current, max, & min) as well as description of current sky
- [ ] Allow the user to commit non-stop searches until they choose to quit
- [ ] From the temperatures given for a certain day (day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) and store them in either a list or dictionary (dictionary would work better)
- [ ] From a certain range of dates (date of day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) from each day and store it in a dictionary
- [ ] Create a counter that increases when a max and min appears when they are within a certain temperature range
- [ ] Print back out the counters for each range of temperature
- [ ] Visualize data so that the counters are shown as a histogram
- [ ] (Optional) Print out recommendations of what the user should wear tomorrow
- [ ] (Optional) TBD
