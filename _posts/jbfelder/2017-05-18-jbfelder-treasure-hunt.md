Reflection: 

  This particular assignment was confusing at times. Having done the reading, video watching, and looking at outside sources such as Stack Overflow I felt competent enough to finish the assignment. Though I knew all of the basics, I tripped up with what should have been the easy stuff such as syntax and placement. I would continually forget to indent and would also forget to place colons at the ends of IF, ElIF, and ELSE declarations. I would also seem to overlook these small instances and believe that my errors came from large problems. Once I realized that I needed to take a step back and ask for help, I would realize that I was overlooking all the small stuff and that I needed to go back over it.
