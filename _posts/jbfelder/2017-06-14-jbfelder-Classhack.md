<strong>Reflection:</strong>
</br>
This assignment was very straightforward, but the requirement of having to go back and hack an already existing trinket is where I experienced much difficulty. I choose to hack my Poetry Slam as I have not worked with Turtles in a while. The examples shown in both the readings and the video help with setting up the classes. However, I had some trouble creating my "Print Poetry" sections of code in my newly made class. For some reason I could not use a For Loop to iterate through the length of a list, so I decided to use an If statement that would increase until the length was met.
