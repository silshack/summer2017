Reflection:

So I initally started off this assignment as an add on to my Treasure Hunt exercise, but this morning I realized I wanted to create something different. So I started all over and tried to make a program where the user could draw what they wanted on the screen using the arrow keys and could click on the screen to make different shapes appear. Most of the work was easy coding. I encountered problems when I tried to create a function where users could change the color of the drawing as well as a function where users could change the shape generated by the clicks. I tried to implement all choices within a list and attempted to have these functions iterate through the different list. And if they reached the final element in the list, it would for it back to the very beginning. I could not originally get this to work, but as I write this reflection it became apparent where I went wrong. I forgot to set the index back to 0. Once I go back in and fix that mistake the code should work.
