<strong>Update:</strong>
</br>
I did not have much time to work on my project yesterday as I had other obligtions. However, with the free time I did have I was able to include a file-saving option, allow users to continually pull data from different locations until they choose to exit, as well as figure out how to pull data from certain day/all days and certain times. A new goal I have is looking for the Max/Min temperature for the whole day rather than a time as the Max and Mins at a certain time do not very much.


Completed:

- [x] Setup API and API-Key so data may be taken from a location
- [x] From the location inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has
- [x] Create user input so user is able to to decide on location while program is running
- [x] From the location the user inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has

To Be Determined/Furthered:

- [x] Show all available data from a certain date
- [x] Make program inform(print) out the next days forecast
- [x] Show all available data from a range of dates
- [ ] From all data available, show only temperature (current, max, & min) from the entire day as well as description of current sky
- [ ] Use text based interface such that Options can give back different types of weather information
- [x] Allow the user to commit non-stop searches until they choose to quit
- [ ] From the temperatures given for a certain day (day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) and store them in either a list or dictionary (dictionary would work better)
- [ ] From a certain range of dates (date of day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) from each day and store it in a dictionary
- [ ] Create a counter that increases when a max and min appears when they are within a certain temperature range
- [ ] Print back out the counters for each range of temperature
- [ ] Visualize data so that the counters are shown as a histogram
- [ ] (Optional) Print out recommendations of what the user should wear tomorrow
- [ ] (Optional) TBD
