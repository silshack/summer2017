<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
So far everything is going somewhat smoothly. Having not had to open and call a URL and making sure to close it has been a challenge, but I stayed up late making sure I understood how to get it to pull data. I believe I'm making good progress, however I'm stuck trying to get certain info from the pulled data to become set in a dictionary. 

Completed 6/13:

- [x] Setup API and API-Key so data may be taken from a location
- [x] From the location inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has
- [x] Create user input so user is able to to decide on location while program is running
- [x] From the location the user inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has

To Be Determined:

- [ ] Show all available data from a certain date
- [ ] Make program inform(print) out the next days forecast
- [ ] Show all available data from a range of dates
- [ ] From all data available, show only temperature (current, max, & min) as well as description of current sky
- [ ] Use text based interface such that Options can give back different types of weather information
- [ ] Allow the user to commit non-stop searches until they choose to quit
- [ ] From the temperatures given for a certain day (day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) and store them in either a list or dictionary (dictionary would work better)
- [ ] From a certain range of dates (date of day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) from each day and store it in a dictionary
- [ ] Create a counter that increases when a max and min appears when they are within a certain temperature range
- [ ] Print back out the counters for each range of temperature
- [ ] Visualize data so that the counters are shown as a histogram
- [ ] (Optional) Print out recommendations of what the user should wear tomorrow
- [ ] (Optional) TBD
