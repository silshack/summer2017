<strong>Reflection:</strong>
</br>
This assignment was very straight and simple to accomplish. I added code so that a user could save their poems to a file, while also adding code for what would happen if they decided against it. I aimed to complete the extra options, but my code was bugged somewhere so I that it would run sometimes and sometimes it would not. I have no idea what caused it as I would not change anything and would get varied results.
