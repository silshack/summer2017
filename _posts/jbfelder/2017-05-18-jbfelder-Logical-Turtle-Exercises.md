Here is the embedded code for my exercise:

Reflection:
  As I initally thought of what I wanted tina to do and become, I started with a process very similar to just "going at it." I would input random commands until I found something I liked. After creating a basic For Loop that would serve as my "Tina builder", I determined that there would have to be some sort of guidelines to make sure that Tina iterated a decent number of times without going crazy. I also made sure Tina implemented a decent amount of basic Turtle commands. The only command I was not able to implement, as I was unsure how to make it run at the right times, was the Fill command. I didn't know whether to put another If statement inside the For Loop to handle whether it was the first iteration and determine how to fill from there. I was unsure if I should use the Try and Except method to use Fill. In the end I scrapped the idea. Polishing the code and adding comments was a breeze as I hadn't experienced any errors. Thus, a simple Turtle program was born.
