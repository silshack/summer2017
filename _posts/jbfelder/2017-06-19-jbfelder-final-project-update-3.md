<strong>Update:</strong>
</br>
This weekend was challenging. Much of my weekend was spent going over and understanding dictionaries. I knew I need to not just implement the code I worked on Friday, but understand how it works completely. Once I did, I used my white-board code to create different dictionaries that took in wind-speed, max temperature, and minimum temperature. Know that all I had to do to take other types of information was just manipulate the code, I focused on getting more of the simpler task completed. I implemented Options that the user can decide from to obtain today's weather, the five day forecast, and a to be determined third option. I also created a new module to store this different types of weather info as the old one was becoming cluttered. I have begun work on taking data from the stored information, storing it in a special variable as a string, printing that string, and then allowing Users to save that string in a file. I am currently stuck pulling different values from the multiple dictionaries, but after I take some time off I will easily get it done.

<strong>Old Milestones:</strong>

Completed:

- [x] Setup API and API-Key so data may be taken from a location
- [x] From the location inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has
- [x] Create user input so user is able to to decide on location while program is running
- [x] From the location the user inputted, show all available data that Open Weather has
- [x] Show all available data from a certain date
- [x] Make program inform(print) out the next days forecast
- [x] Show all available data from a range of dates
- [x] Allow the user to commit non-stop searches until they choose to quit

To Be Determined/Furthered:

- [ ] From all data available, show only temperature (current, max, & min) from the entire day as well as description of current sky
- [ ] Use text based interface such that Options can give back different types of weather information
- [ ] From the temperatures given for a certain day (day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) and store them in either a list or dictionary (dictionary would work better)
- [ ] From a certain range of dates (date of day is the key), take the temperature (current, max, and min) from each day and store it in a dictionary
- [ ] Create a counter that increases when a max and min appears when they are within a certain temperature range
- [ ] Print back out the counters for each range of temperature
- [ ] Visualize data so that the counters are shown as a histogram
- [ ] (Optional) Print out recommendations of what the user should wear tomorrow
- [ ] (Optional) TBD

To Be Determined/Furthered:

- [ ] Create a file saving system.
- [ ] From all data available, show only temperature (current, max, & min) from the entire day as well as description of current sky
- [ ] Options send back 1) Todays info, 2) 5-Day Forecast, 3) Not Sure Yet
- [ ] Create a counter that increases when a max and min appears when they are within a certain temperature range
- [ ] Print back out the counters for each range of temperature
- [ ] Visualize data so that the counters are shown as a histogram 

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] (Optional) Print out recommendations of what the user should wear tomorrow
- [ ] (Optional) TBD
