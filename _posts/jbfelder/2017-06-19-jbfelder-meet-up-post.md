<strong>Meet-Up Reflection:</strong>
</br>
For my meet-up, I (along with several other members of the class) decided to go to the Tripython meet-up held on June 14th. Overall, it was a pretty casual experience. Though not a large group, everyone in the room came from different backgrounds and area but all want to learn how to work with python. As expected everyone went around the room and shared how they were as well as why they had come for the night. After that, everyone split up to work on their own assignments while giving help to those who may need it. While not a professional or business event, I was still nice to see different people come together to give and recieve help. I can see myself returning to the next Tripython meet up if only to get ideas for new projects.
