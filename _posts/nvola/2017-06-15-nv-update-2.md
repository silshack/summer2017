Here is my updated trinket:

Since last class I completed the analysis three skeleton code. However, I then decided to go for my stretch goals of allowing multi-region analysis for both percent change and descriptive stats. Being able to successfully implement those, I decided to merge what I had previously defined as analysis two and analysis three so that it's just one menu option. I was also able to create a custom class (really a class extension of lists) that was helpful in cleaning up my code a bit. Here's a snapshot of what I have in my custom class so far:

```
class Data():
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
  
  def printData(self):
    print(self.data)
  
  def showData(self):
    for i in range(len(self.data)):
      print("\t \t".join(self.data[i]))
  
  def getMaxNum(self):
    var_max = max(self.data)
    return var_max
  
  def append(self, a_value):
    self.data.append(a_value)
  
  def getMinNum(self):
    var_min = min(self.data)
    return var_min
    
  def getAverage(self):
    avg = round(sum(self.data)/len(self.data),2)
    return avg
```

So far, it looks like I'm on pretty much on time with all my milestones. Moving forward, I still think my major roadblock will be time, and I'd also like to test my program against a third data set to ensure it can really do what I think it can. My goal with  the program is for it to be really flexible to support analysis for different types of data as long as regions (or region-like levels of analysis) and years (or other types of time series). 

Here's my updated milestone list:

Already achieved
- [x] read user file (csv format)
- [x] read headers in user file
- [x] pull relevant variable based on user input (based on file headerss)
- [x] create menu for 3 analysis options
- [x] create analysis one skeleton code
- [x] menu/user instructions
- [x] accept user input for necessary information
- [x] present available regions from data
- [x] present available years from data
 
To be achieved by Wednesday: 
- [x] present available variables from data
- [x] create analysis two skeleton code
- [x] create analysis three skeleton code
 
To be achieved by Monday:
- [ ] create visualization for analysis one
  
To be achieved by Tuesday:
- [ ] create visualization for analysis two
- [ ] create visualization for analysis three
- [ ] incorporate regular expressions to allow flexibility on user input
 
Stretch goals:
- [x] implement capability to do multi-region analysis for percent change
- [x] make the descriptive statitics analysis flexible to compute either one region or multiple regions so it can be one menu option
- [ ] allow percent change (analysis one) to be computed at the intervening intervals between the user's chosen end and start date
