Change the code below to print a readout of your own design with what you consider to be the most relevant pieces of data.  Your program
should not print out a raw dict/json, but rather a nicely formatted, human-readable summary of at least 4 pieces of information about
the location the user has input.

Add error checking so your program does not traceback if the data you chose (like country code) does not exist for a location.

When testing, pick a wide range of locations, "27707" "New York" "Atlantic Ocean" "Chapel Hill, NC" etc., to make sure your program is robust.
