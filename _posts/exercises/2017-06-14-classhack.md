title: "Class Hack"
---

Submit a well-formatted pull request with a hack of one of your previous trinkets that uses **classes**.  This can be Turtle or text-based.  Your class can be constructed from scratch or extended from a built-in class.  For Turtle Finals, I HIGHLY recommend wathcing the portions of my video that deal with class extension.  Even if you're doing a text-based final, you can complete this with Turtle, but it might be more helpful to do it in a text-based way so that it's translateable to the requirements of your final.

The purpose of this exercise is to get you hands-on with classes in a program you're already familiar with so that it's easier to incorporate them into your final.
