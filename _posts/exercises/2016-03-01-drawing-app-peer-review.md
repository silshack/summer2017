published: false
---

Submit a well-formatted pull request with a 500+ word peer review of your partner's
drawing app.  ~~Your partner will be the same one as in the clinic, which will help you evaluate a little of the app's evolution. Here they are for reference:~~

**EDIT:** tsukori, wfh1972, camazotz, and gao14g have been reassigned for the peer review.  Everyone else stays the same.

Your peer review/reflection should contain the following sections:

# The app

The assignment stated that the app should:

* Have an entirely graphical user interface (i.e. no printed text input besides
what turtle.write())
* Allow the user to select a drawing mode that changes the program's repsonse to clicks and/or keys
* Display the current mode and other relevant information to the user
* Allow the user to choose and draw shapes, lines, and colors depending upon the selected mode
* Allow the user to clear the drawing and start over

Did it?  What strikes you about your partner's app, its functionality, and its interface?

# The code

The assignment stated that the code should:

* Utilize custom modules for readability and organization
* Utilize custom functions for modularity
* Utilize definite loops (i.e. `for` loops)
* Utilize multiple Turtle objects
* Utilize a named Screen object
* Run without errors
* Be well-commented
* Be well-organized and readable

Did it?  How did your partner's code contribute to the app's functionality and interface?

# The process

Looking over your partner's reflection, initial milestones and final milestones, how did they 
approach this project?  Did they adapt their process in response to challenges?  Were their
milestones clearly stated, acheiveable, and collectively sufficient to satisfy the project
requirements?

# Self-reflection

How did your partner's app, code and process differ from yours?  What can you learn from them?
What did you like about what they did?  What did you dislike?  Looking back on your work,
how would you evaluate yourself?
