Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with embedded Trinket programs for the below exercises.
Complete these on your own, using any materials you need. Make sure your post has the correct author metadata,
`layout: post`, and a title that's descriptive. Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.  

**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
Include a reflection about what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you.
Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?

___

Create a turtle program that uses **variables**, **conditionals**, **operators**, and **user input**.

You're welcome to use loops for this if that's something you're comfortable with.  Don't use functions
yet.

Make this program responsive to the user input, using **conditionals**.  Get creative! Can you give your
program **replay value?** with your use of conditionals?
