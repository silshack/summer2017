Nothing to see here...

I'm not sure if I bit off more than I can chew with this project. I think I'm going to just have it import .txt files from a webpage, unless I can find an easy tool for scraping the text of a website. 
It also kind of stinks that I am so busy during the work week, so I don't have any time to really work on the project until the weekend. I'm honestly really discouraged. I think the fast pace of this course is too much for me.

My updated milestones are:

 [ ]   Read and scrape webpage
 [ ]   Store the text of the webpage into a .txt file
 [ ]   Calculate average word, sentence, paragraph lengths
 [ ]   Find "grade level" writing statistics to compare webpage to
 [ ]   Calculate grade level of webpage
 [ ]   Do some sort of data visualization with the statistics

Advanced milestones:

  [ ]  Find common words/phrases from known examples of hate literature
  [ ]  Compare website content to hate speech
  [ ]  Generate "hate score" of website
