I want to do a data analysis tool that asks the user to input a URL and the program scrapes the text to determine the most common words used in the file (interesting words, not "the", "a", "an", etc.) I would like to also see the average word length, sentence length, and paragraph length (in words). Ideally, I could compare it to some standardized formula somehwere that will help me determine the grade level of the writing. I am interested in studying hate speech online, and I wondered if I could find a way to help identify hate speech automatically. I could load up a dictionary or list of words from known works of hate literature, and then compare the user's inputted URL to those works. This might be a way to flag heinous online content. 

My initial milestones are:
<ul>
<li>Read and scrape webpage</li>
<li>Calculate average word, sentence, paragraph lengths</li>
<li>Find "grade level" writing statistics to compare webpage to</li>
<li>Calculate grade level of webpage</li>

Advanced milestones:
<li>Find common words/phrases from known examples of hate literature</li>
<li>Compare website content to hate speech</li>
<li>Generate "hate score" of website</li>
