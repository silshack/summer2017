Nothing to see here...
I want to do a data analysis tool that asks the user to input a URL and the program scrapes the text to determine the most common words used in the file (interesting words, not "the", "a", "an", etc.) I would like to also see the average word length, sentence length, and paragraph length (in words). Ideally, I could compare it to some standardized formula somehwere that will help me determine the grade level of the writing. I am interested in studying hate speech online, and I wondered if I could find a way to help identify hate speech automatically. I could load up a dictionary or list of words from known works of hate literature, and then compare the user's inputted URL to those works. This might be a way to flag heinous online content. 

My initial milestones are:
<ul>
<li>Read and scrape webpage</li>
<li>Calculate average word, sentence, paragraph lengths</li>
<li>Find "grade level" writing statistics to compare webpage to</li>
<li>Calculate grade level of webpage</li>
</ul>

Advanced milestones:
<ul>
<li>Find common words/phrases from known examples of hate literature</li>
<li>Compare website content to hate speech</li>
<li>Generate "hate score" of website</li>
</ul>
I'm not sure if I bit off more than I can chew with this project. I think I'm going to just have it import .txt files from a webpage, unless I can find an easy tool for scraping the text of a website. 
It also kind of stinks that I am so busy during the work week, so I don't have any time to really work on the project until the weekend. I'm honestly really discouraged. I think the fast pace of this course is too much for me.

My updated milestones are:

 [ ]   Read and scrape webpage
 [ ]   Store the text of the webpage into a .txt file
 [ ]   Calculate average word, sentence, paragraph lengths
 [ ]   Find "grade level" writing statistics to compare webpage to
 [ ]   Calculate grade level of webpage
 [ ]   Do some sort of data visualization with the statistics

Stretch milestones:

  [ ]  Find common words/phrases from known examples of hate literature
  [ ]  Compare website content to hate speech
  [ ]  Generate "hate score" of website
