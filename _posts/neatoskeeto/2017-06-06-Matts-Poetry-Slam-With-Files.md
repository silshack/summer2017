I feel a lot better about this version of the poetry slam app than the first one. I didn't understand lists enough to know how to add parts of the string that were too long in a new line. I used some of the code from one of the samples to figure that out.
However, I don't know why the code lets the poem go beyond the bottom of the screen in the case where it makes a new line for lines with too many characters. I moved that "elif" statement so that it is second, and I think that might have helped? 

I think I got it to create the file, but I'm not sure. My test file says:
```
[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
```

At least I got it to save a file!
