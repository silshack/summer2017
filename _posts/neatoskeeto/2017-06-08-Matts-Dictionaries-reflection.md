Dictionaries seem like pretty powerful tools in python. I like that it makes things much easier to read because you assign keys to things, which makes it so that you don't have to remember the exact index of a value in a list. However, the (seemingly) random nature of how functions and loops print dictionaries confuse me. Why can't dictionaries be treated like lists and print output the same way every time? It is easy enough to use the sorted method, however, so it's not a big deal. I think dictionaries will prove to be very useful for my final project, but I don't know exactly how, because I don't know if I want to make a game or a data analysis program.
