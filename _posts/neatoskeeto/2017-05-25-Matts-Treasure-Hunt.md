I was able to do it pretty easily by asking for users to type in the x and y coordinates, so I went for the bonus challenge of doing the mouse click.
I can't figure out how to make the turtle go to the mouse click area without leaving a trace line, and I also can't figure out how to make the program pause and wait for the user to click another spot before continuing the loop.
When you play it, it automatically loops forever until you find the treasure. 

In general, this game was pretty fun, and I'm pretty sure I could figure out how to fix my issues, but I didn't have the time.
