Ooh, boy. I can't for the life of me figure out why the thing only makes the yellow dart board. It is starting to hurt my eyes! I had a lot of trouble in general with the first function definition: getting the user to chose the color. 
At first, it would make the outermost ring black no matter what, but then I fixed that issue.

Another issue I had was from the dart throw function. I orignally had the variables labeled "miss" and "bullseye."  That caused some sort of error, so I changed them to 1 and 2. I still don't know why I couldn't just use the original names.
