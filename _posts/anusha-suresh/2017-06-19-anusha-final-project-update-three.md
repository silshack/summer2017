So Here was my original list of milestones, filled in with what I believe I have accomplished or an close to accomplishing:
- [x] program can read the file correctly.
- [x] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [x] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [x] program uses a list to store different data 
- [ ] let the program display one chart for each data file
- [ ] program uses a class to do something
- [x] user can choose what they want to see from the data.
- [x] program can run speedily, hopefully. (one file has 1.7 million entries, soâ€¦)
- [x] program uses a dictionary to store some data
- [x] program can print information

When you look at my code now, it doesn't seem like much, but to me, where I was last week to where I am now is a whole world all together. I spent the entire weekend going through my code function by function then line by line. After I was able to get a few of the functions working on their own, I moved on to the user interface of it. I think I have covered most of the basic things that we were to include except classes. I haven't yet understood how to include a class into my program, but that is something I a working on today. My program has one histogram right now where it shows the number of times each item turns up in the data set. The issue I was having with I guess both of my files, was indexing it correctly. What I would use once wouldn't work for another part of the data, so that took a long time to figure out. But I am really happy with my dictionary because I got the attribute and the key to be the two different columns from the data set and that made me really happy because I kind of just guessed to make it do that. In terms of the user interface right now, it kind of does what I want it to do, but not exactly. It is kind of hard to explain, but the program is not asking questions I guess when it is supposed to, and so I think I need to figure that out too today. In terms of going forward, I would like the program to be able to do more than just the basics. So, I think I would like to include a second histogram for my other data set, and I would like to add a few more functions, once I figure out what to do with the data. I think these are two milestones I want to add, but also would only add them if I can first figure out how to include a class. All in all, things are looking up for this project, I hope.

Here is my code:
