title: "Anusha's Revised Milestones List"
---

So my original list was:
- [ ] include the files in the appropriate format 
- [ ] create a set of instructions for the user 
- [ ] let the user input a file, and be able to open the file prompt the user for what they want from the data 
- [ ] let the program print out the appropriate things 
- [ ] figure out how to include a class

What I learned after talking about the project with my group today and just hearing ideas, I understand what the project wants a whole lot more. With that, I really really am not a fan of writing out my goals, just because of past experiences, but I understand why they are important. Thus my revised list of milestones is: 
- [ ] program can read the file correctly. 
- [ ] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [ ] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [ ] let the program display one chart for each data file
- [ ] program uses a class to to something
- [ ] user can choose what they want to see from the data.
- [ ] program can run speedily, hopefully. (one file has 1.7 million entries, so...)
- [ ] program uses a dictionary to store some data
- [ ] program uses a list to store different data.
- [ ] program can print information

I think this is a better list than what I had before, but I think I should still be able to add more once I have begun my project and am able to see where it is going. By no means is this list conclusive, but I think it is indicative to where I am at this point in this project. I still feel like my data is suitable though it may not be interesting. I think trajectory is looking good for this project right now, but I think asking me once I have started will be a whole lot more telling.
