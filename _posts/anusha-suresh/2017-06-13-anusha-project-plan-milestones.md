I have chosen to work on the data analysis for my final project. I think that it is going to be somewhat of a challenge for me because I still haven't completely understood certain things, but I think it should be fine. I do still have some questions for the assignment, like if the files have to be different and our code should work for both? Or like hwat exactly is the user supposed to be able to do with the program? I think I'm just thinking about the project too much that I might be overthinking it. In other news, as of now the two data files I have chose have to do with a list of medicare provides and medicare inpatient payment system data. I think they should be okay to work with once I get started, I hope. As far as milestones go, my preliminary list is:
  include the files in the appropriate format
  create a set of instructions for the user
  let the user input a file, and be able to open the file
  prompt the user for what they want from the data
  let the program print out the appropriate things
  figure out how to include a class

I think I have an idea of where to go, but I'm not sure if what I am thinking is the sane as what is required, so it'll be an interesting experience.
