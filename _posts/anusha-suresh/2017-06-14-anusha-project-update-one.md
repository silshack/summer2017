So here was the list of milestones I published after class yesterday:
- [ ] program can read the file correctly. 
- [ ] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [ ] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [ ] let the program display one chart for each data file
- [ ] program uses a class to to something
- [ ] user can choose what they want to see from the data.
- [ ] program can run speedily, hopefully. (one file has 1.7 million entries, so...)
- [ ] program uses a dictionary to store some data
- [ ] program uses a list to store different data.
- [ ] program can print information

And of those milestones, I feel like where I am at is behind and there is still much to be done. Some of the milestones, I think I am partially getting there. These are the ones I think I am getting somewhere with:
- [ ] program can read the file correctly.
- [ ] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [ ] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [ ] program uses a list to store different data.


This nothing because I feel like I should have made more progress. What got me behind was cleaning up a file. I stupidly did one the manual way so that I would be able to get information about each type of thing that providers can cover. But it took positvely forever and I don't know why that was a good idea, but now I have a good sample of data for that file. It has a variety of providers and illnesses so there's that. However, I did not make the same mistake for the other file. I chose the 1000 rows for that one, from the 1.7 million, and I'm going to hope that is fine. I learnt the hard way that just because you like big files doesn't mean programs like big files.

I'm running a few errors with this current code, and I am unsure as to why this is happening because the formatting is correct. I am hoping to get some clarification on this so I can move forward. This error is throwing me off because I like to see what my program is doing, but this error isn't letting me, so I feel like I am blindly working. I have created some defintions in the helper_one and helper_two files. These two are mainly working with lists, but I think over the next few days I might change some lists into dictionaries, or create a separate dictionary for the providers list. I've started one dictionary, to take in the ID value, but I am not sure how it is working. I think I want to be able to associate their ID or last name with a key. I'm still working out how to include the data visualization, but I think instead having one for each file, I may just start by trying to include one with the payment system file. 

I hope to be in a much better spot over the next couple of days, but here is where I am right now:
