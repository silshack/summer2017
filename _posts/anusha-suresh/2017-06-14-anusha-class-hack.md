and reflection:
So for some reason, this exercise let everything that could go wrong, go wrong. I think the page froze about six times all together when I started messsing with classes. I wasn't really understanding how to extend them or make them, and trinket and I had a little war going on with each other. At one point, trinket pretty much won said war too. In all my duplications of trinkets, and deleting said trinkets, I accidentally deleted the poetry slam files assignment. I was greatly saddened by this, so naturally I decided that something had to give dignity to this defeat. So, I decided to 'hack' the original poetry slam assignment. As mentioned, I had a lot of trouble extending the class. I wasn't sure how to do it even after reading and rereading the assigned texts, but then something clicked when I remembered how we used to assign tina. So when I figured that out, I ran into another issue, which was my program stopped doing things, which is when I realized classes need functions. This is when I moved he entire while loop ino a definition, then into a class. After this, the issues were minor like importing tutle in somplaces, etc. All in all, I believe the class hack has worked. As far as this trinket war, til next time my friend.
