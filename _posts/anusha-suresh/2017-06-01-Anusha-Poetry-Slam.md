And my reflection:
For some reason it took me a long time to figure this out. By the time I got to the end, I had tried such a variety of things including defintions and while loops and try blocks. Lo and behold, the solution was a combination of all of these. I started first with while loops and when it wasn't working, I tried to make a defintion to make the words move lines, but I realized quickly that was a really complicated way of doing it. Try blocks were included in all of my trials. I came to a point where everything I was doing resulted in the same thing, the words printing next to each other and on top of each other. Then I figured the \n should work, but it only added a space between words. Then I tried a for loop, this one ended up with words printing on top of and next to each other. Then I thought about it and remembered the count method exercise we were doing and some of the things from clicky turtles and treasure hunt and came to this solution. I don't fully understand it yet, but I think I mostly do. I was really suprised to learn that the placement of the input line is crucial. Actually, I learned that one the hard way. In the future, I hope to be able to understand enough to do the advanced part of the activity
