title: "Anusha's Second Project Update"
---

So this project has just been issue after isssue and it's bumming me out because it feels like the effort I want to put in, just isn't happening. So yesterday, I was running some errors, and I tried resolving them with some of the things my group members suggested, but those didn't help. Then I was at a meetup group and had someone there try to help, but that didn't help either. I finally settled on asking Elliot, and he was really helpful in describing why my errors are there. 
As of now there are no new updates to my code, which I am really unhappy about. I got really sick and wasn't able to work on my code as I wanted to. After Elliott's feedback and everything, I have moved my code to a python 3 trinket and have commented everything out. I am currently working on figuring out what each individual piece of code is doing. I have decided the best way for me to see what my code is doing is taking everything piece by piece. Thus I have commented out all my data and working function by function. Hopefully once I figure out what each function is doing on it's on and resolving them to fit my milestones, I'll be able to put everything together for the final program. As such, my milestones remain the same. These I feel like are one step forward two steps back:
- [ ] program can read the file correctly.
- [ ] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [ ] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [ ] program uses a list to store different data
Here is my whole list:
- [ ] program can read the file correctly. 
- [ ] the user can see a set of instructions and a list of program abilities while using the program.
- [ ] let the user choose which of two files they want to see data from
- [ ] let the program display one chart for each data file
- [ ] program uses a class to to something
- [ ] user can choose what they want to see from the data.
- [ ] program can run speedily, hopefully. (one file has 1.7 million entries, so...)
- [ ] program uses a dictionary to store some data
- [ ] program uses a list to store different data.
- [ ] program can print information

I'm not happy with where I am but hopefully with todays class and the weekend I will be in a better position.
