And My reflection:
I thought this exercise was kind of interesting. It was cool because you are analyzing live data and real data from the web. Not that other data isn't real, but the point is, it is not a file and it isn't data that you or storing. I had some trouble understanding how to index the data, I had the same trouble with my dictionary exercises as well, so I think I need to understand them more if I am to go working on dictionaries in the future. For this exercise, I kind of went with the pattern that was given and went from there, it seems to work, I think. I commented out some of the print statements from the original code because it looked like those statements were the ones that made much of the output unreadable. When I was thinking of what information to put in, I figured the basics would be best, so I figured city, county, and state would be the best. I also don't think I understood everything in the dictionary, so going forward, including things like country code could be fun. I kept the coordinates in there too because coordinates are fun. I put the entire while loop in a try block to be able to use the except for error catching. It is kind of strange how it works because if you enter like 55 you get coordinates and a location but it isn't a location. I want to figure out what is going on there eventually. Finally, I added a series of underscores to make sort of a line to separate out the locations. Maybe it was because I was hungry or my eyes were being weird, but it was just a strain to follow the new lines each time, so I thought this made it easier on the eyes. I'm happy with the overall product, but there is definately room for improvement.
