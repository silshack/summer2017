title: "Cultural Immersion Meetup Experience"

I attended this meet up with "TriPython Users Group"(formerly TriZPUG),on the evening of May 25th at Web Assign's Corporate office on NC state University Campus. This was my very first meet up of this kind and I was really apprehensive for various reasons. 
At that particular point, my relationship with Python was precisely a week old and I was still trying to get hang of basics of Python. The presentation was on "Microservices". I had zero knowledge about the subject and than I was also not sure ,how well I will be received. Their meetup invite said that its an open meetup ,anybody with any amount of Python experience can join so that was promising. Moreover I was given a little briefing about Microservices by my Professor so I was not completely in the dark.
when I reached the meet up location, the organizer that day was this very kind gentle man ( named 'Steve'), who welcomed all of us (and offered us food as well). Next was Introductions.There were almost 25 - 30 people from different companies, backgrounds and ages with different levels of Python experience. I felt a lot better when I saw few familiar faces from our class in the crowd as well.
The Presentation was by this brilliant young lady,Stacy Morse, who gave an excellent and engaging Presentation on the Definition and meaning of microsrvices, the difference between 'monolith' and 'Microservices' and how each gets deployed.She talked about her work related with LinkApp and her future goals. 
I did try to gather as much information as I could and learnt a little bit about what microservices are and how they worked.There are so many definitions and I liked Stacy's own definition as well which is ," Small services that are independent and purpose driven"
The presentation was followed by a very healthy and informative question/answer session and discussions. Many people shared their experiences with Microservices and Python in general .
Overall it was a very enlightening experience. This was the first time I was in company of so many software intellectuals but I never felt for a moment that I did not belong. It was like a community of people who seemed connected without even knowing too much about each other.
They are very accepting , open minded,helpful and seemed completey non judgemental.These are the kind of people you generally want to hang out with. 
I do plan to attend these meet ups in the future as well. I find their enthusiasm about Python and their work related to it, quite contagious. I think this environment  will really help me push my boundaries and thrive as a brand new programmer.
