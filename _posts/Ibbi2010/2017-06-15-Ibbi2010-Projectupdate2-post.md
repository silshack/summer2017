title: "Final Project update 2"
---
I dont think I will be able to stress any less until I see my final project taking shape. I did plan to take baby steps but there are a lot of" whatifs" which want me to achieve more milestones than I am capable of I think. I was able to achieve the basic task I had set for myself, i.e Creating the taggers Class but that came with a lot of roadblocks .I had to do many adjustments. The main issue I faced was when some function in my program worked in one module and would stop working in another. It took me a long time to figure out that issue . Ultimately I had to transfer a lot of my code in main.py which made everything pretty haphazard. I have not been able to organize my code to my liking yet.
Another major road block was to figure out how to make my " Baseball bases" flash on intersection. It took me a very long time of searching a way and eventually at one fine moment I decided to watch another game video. Thank you "Elliot Hauser" for coming to my rescue. It gave me a vision and a code which I was able to utilize with little tweaking. All this took little longer than I would have liked but I managed to pull it off in the end.
I have not been able to make a "Lose"and "reset" screen. That is my upcoming milestone.
I think my milestones are appropriately ambitious, as long as I keep accomplishing them.
Here's the list of my milestones

 - [x] Create setup screen
 - [x] User Instructions
 - [x] Create Runner
 - [x] Make Tag turtles Class
 - [ ] organize my code
 - [ ] Make timer ?
 - [x] Make win screen
 - [ ] Make lose screen and reset
 - [ ] Get my check_position to work
 - [ ]start finding way to introduce all the essential requirements of the assignment
 And heres the code for what I have done so far
