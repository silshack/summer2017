Peer Review:
 Here is my review for Nura's Drawing App. As far as the assignments requirements are concerned,Nura was successfully able to fulfill most of them.I really like the fact that She kept it simple as well as interactive enough to be able to perform many functions.
 Below is the list of requirements met by Nura's Drawing App:
 ```python
 -The App is User friendly,clean and precise
 -The code is clear and wellcommented
 -Even in the single module, it is organized very well and is readable.
 -All the functions are commented and explanatory.
 -Nura had set realistic milestones and was able to achieve most of them.
 -Her reflection describes her process clearly.She did modify her initial milestones and kept her perspective the whole time,which made her able to finish the App successfully.
 -I do however feel that She will be able to achieve more of her milestones,in terms of design and other improvemets given some more time and knowledge as she mentioned in her reflection as well.
 ```
 As far as the code goes
 ```python
 -All the code is in main.py
 -She has been able to use custom functions.
 -There are a couple of "for loops", for change in background color and in making a star shape.
 - As I mentioned earlier as well,it is wellcommented,organized and readable.
 -It does run smoothly without any errors. The only glitch is the disapperance of the legend which happens with the background color change(Nura has mentioned this in her rfelction as well)
 ```
Process: 
Nura was able to meet most of the assignments requirements because of the fact that she kept it realitically achievable. She also modified her plan of action according to her coding knowledge. I believe thats the best strategy if one does not feel 100% confident about how the bigger plan will turn out. Like how our professor says to try to achieve smaller milestones first.
Self Reflection:
Going through Nura's App making process, I realized that there are many achievable things which I coud have achieved had I set my heart and goals into that. My whole process was completely different from hers.I wanted to do and make something drastically different. I did have a choice to make somthing simpler and be able to satisfy atleast the basic requirements of the assignment. In Nura's App ,I liked the fact the she made a star shape. Its different from the usual square and circles etc. I essentially did not dislike anything. I am very well aware of the fact what goes through the process of these kind of assignments. Positive and contructive criticism might be educational but I believe critisizing one's brain child is like critisizing one's child:) 
Well the major take home lesson for me from all of this is to take baby steps, achieve smaller milestones, there is nothing wrong with having the similar ideas ( though I still have doubts about this one).Had I done all this ,I would have passed instead of  having faced a "graceful failure".
