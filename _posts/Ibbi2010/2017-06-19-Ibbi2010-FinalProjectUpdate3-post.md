title: "Final Project update 3"
---

I really wanted to finalize my project during the weekend and I was really disheartened to see my progress. I worked continously to resolve various issues I had been facing. I had not clarified in my milestones but secretly my objective was to go above and beyond my milestones . I thought I had time, what I didnt know was that sometimes time is not the only thing you need. I am sure my hurdles might not sound too big to some but they were for me. It was frustrating to try to figure out the solution to little problems but when I did ,it was equally rewarding as well e.g, getting my timer to work and restricting runners movements beyond certain x and y coordinates.
But I feel these rewarding moments were few and far between. So much so that I decided to do a major revision in my milestones list.
I really want to figure the problems at hand before proceeding further to make any new additions to the program.
I am sure I will be able to figure out some of those in class today. It might be something I am overlooking or have no knowledge about.
From there on ,I will decide my next plan of action. 
All I want from this point onwards is ,my program to run error free and do soemthing. It does not sound too ambitious and I feel bad about it but I have to keep my nerves in order as well.
This is what I have been able to accomplish so far
