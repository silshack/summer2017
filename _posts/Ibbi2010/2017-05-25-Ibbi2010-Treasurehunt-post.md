Reflection:
      This assignment seemed a little easier since most of the code input was provided but I did struggle with it.
      I ept it pretty simple and as close to the origial as possible because of the problems I was facing in finally making the program to     work. I mostly had a problem with the while loop and figuring out a distance  between the treasure and user turtle.
      I was eventually able to complte my assignment with Elliott's help.
