Getting the idea about the perfect program which incorporates all the elements of the assignment, was the hardest part.
I am still not sure whether I was supposed to include some turtle drawing using variables and conditionals etc as well?
when I thought about what excites me the most,I settles on "Food".
This program is user interactive to get to know about user's food prefernces. Its rather a very simple program for a beginner like me but 
it did satisfy all the requirements for this assignment( I hope so!)
I did come across many hurdles regarding te best approach to grading the spice level. mostly were syntax errors but I figured them out 
mostly by consulting the previous exercises and trinket tutorials. It was easier for me to conceptualize but materializing the concepts
in the program was time consuming and challenging.

Here is my "Foodie's world"
