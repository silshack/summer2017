I already had the initial setup for the App done before yesterday, so my last day's milestones were to create a "Runner" and "Tagger turtles" and get the game running atleast. I have been able to include the instructions and moving runner turtle but I have not been able to create Tag turtles,class. Also I feel that ,my code right now is very haphazard and there is a lot of tweaking which needs to be done.
My revised milestones list will be:

- [x] Create setup screen
- [x] User Instructions
- [x] Create Runner
- [ ] Make Tag turtles Class
- [ ] organize my code
- [ ] Make score board
- [ ] Make win and lose screen
- [ ] create a timer for the time runner takes to make the home run( I am not sure about this one but this will be one of the ways to increase the difficulty levels)
- [ ] start finding way to introduce all the essential requirements of the assignment

I am not being super ambitious with my milestones right now as I want to keep them achievable for now to pump up my confidence. I have not been able to shake off last assignment's failure from my mind. This project is more about nerves than anything else for me and I dont want to lose it in the middle of the project. Thank fully I have a great team and a good time line to come up with improvements in my milesstones.
For the next class I do want to be able to create Tag turtles class . I will place them at random positions and make them head towards the runner. I still have to figure out if there is a way to limit there movement speed. Next would be creating a score board and win/lose screen.
