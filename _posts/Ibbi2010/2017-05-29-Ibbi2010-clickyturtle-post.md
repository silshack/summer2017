Reflection:
I basically took the template code provided to us and without changing it much,tried to incorporate all the elements required by this assignment.From the very beginning I knew that I want to make somthing simple like a flower on screen click.I knew I can write a code for flower myself but I did not want to waste time on it so I got the code from trinket for my flower and defined it as my helper function in clicky function. Since its a very simple demonstration of screen click function,I did not encounter many hurdles.The only problem I did face was the artefacts which I tried to took care of with 
```
tina.tracer(0)
tina.tracer(1)
```
It is still giving me artefacts sometimes though. Also I had some penup(),pendown() issues but I was able to take care of those.
One thing which I would definitelt like to mention is that O Reily videos were really helpful during this assignment.
Here is the code for my program
