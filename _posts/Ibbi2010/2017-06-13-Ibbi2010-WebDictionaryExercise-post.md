title: "Web Dictinary Exercise"

Reflection:
 This exercise did not go smooth at all. I went through the recommeded chapters twice to understand the concepts and vocab. I also warched Dr.Chuck's you tube videos regarding Web dictionaries . I am still wrapping my head around a lot of information. I managed to understand a little bit but again the problem came while executing the code. It was hard for me to understand the question and write the perfect code to produce the required results. I tried multiple things but got into one error or another. I got frustrated and at one point decided to leave the exercise. But after taking a break I came back to it and tried it one last time before googling for the solution.
 sometimes I understand things better in coding when I look at the solutions. I found the code in trinket and I have essentially copied and pasted it.I did it for my own good to get a clear idea of how to use the web dictionaries. I still have a couple of hours  before the class and I intend to learn it on my own but if not, I will be heavily relying on class notes and pull requests from others.
 
 Following is the trinket code:
