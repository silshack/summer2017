Reflection: The whole process involving this assignment was no less than a rollercoaster for me. I think I have let myself down on this one. I was not able to achieve many of the milestones I had set for myself. Before starting this particular assignment,I was really excited. I finished up all my other work early up during the weekend so that I can give my maximum time to it.I started with watching Safari videos and got so caught up that I watched the game app videos as well till the wrap-up. somewhere while watching the videos, I dont know how this thing got stuck in my head that we are supposed to make either blackjack or a game app. I know this sounds really silly and irresponsible , but thats the honest fact. I spent next 2 days making a very elaborate game sketch(elaborate in my case).
when I went back to see the assignment requirments,I realized that I had to make a drawing app instead.This realization dampened my spirits. I started back on but I had no idea how to go about it. All the concepts from watching the videos were very clear in my mind but I wanted to do something diffrent,with the best of my abilities. 
The main idea I had, was to make different shapes and let the user pick a color to fill up those shapes.I wanted to keep it clean and simple but at the same time interactive and usable.
I did make few shapes in the form of a house and a tree and kept them un colored,finding ways to accoplish my goals. I could not come up with anything solid. So I ended up filling the colors and putting my functions, "onkeys" only.Through out the process,I was able to make whatever code I wrote, work and organize in different modules. More than an app,I think its a drawing and it was very easy for me.which makes my belief firm that I have not done enough for this assignment. I do take a little comfort in the fact that I have come a long way and achieving even this much was unfathomable 2 weeks back. 
My revised  milestones:

```python
Entirely graphical user interface
selecting different drawing modes
allow the user to choose colors,shapes and lines
allow the user to clearand start over
enhace the creativity and usability of app
```
The milestones, I was able to achieve:
```
utilized custom modules for organization and readability
well commented
utilize named screen object
run without errors
distinct from the app in the video
```
