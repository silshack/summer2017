Reflection:
This assignment was pretty straight forward. I wanted to make the screen look pretty for the poetry text.Taking care of that was a breeze.I later started with the very basic "while loop" for user input. I was able to get the text on the screen but It took me a little while to figure out how to get my text on screen altogether after "done".

One thing which I notice whenever I am doing assignments is, that I keep getting back to the references for even the basic things.I am sure, a lot of this has to do with my lack of familiarity with the code.This time too, I went back and read the class notes as well as the chapters again.
I did the basic assignment and did not go for the advanced part of the assignment like limiting the character input by the user and figuring out the space.
